# Stage, preview impacts, and enforce policy

## Big picture

Stage and preview impacts on traffic before enforcing policy.

## Value

$[prodname] staged network policy resources lets you test the traffic impact of the policy as if it were enforced, but without changing traffic flow. You can also preview the impacts of a staged policy on existing traffic. By verifying that correct flows are allowed and denied before enforcement, you can minimize misconfiguration and potential network disruption.

## Concepts

### About staged policies

The following staged policy resources have the same structure (i.e. the resource spec has the same fields) as their “enforced” counterpart.

- Staged global network policy
- Staged network policy
- Staged Kubernetes network policy

## How to

- [Stage a policy](#stage-a-policy)
- [Preview policy impact](#preview-policy-impact)
- [Enforce a staged policy](#enforce-a-staged-policy)

### Stage a policy

Stage a policy to test it in a near replica of a production environment. A best practice is to stage a policy before enforcing it to avoid unintentionally exposing or blocking other network traffic.
You can use custom resources to stage Kubernetes and $[prodname] policies, and apply them using `kubectl`. Here are sample YAML files.

**Example: StagedGlobalNetworkPolicy**

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: StagedGlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default.allow-tcp-6379
spec:
  tier: default
  selector: role == 'database'
  types:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: role == 'frontend'
      destination:
        ports:
          - 6379
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

**Example: StagedNetworkPolicy**

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: StagedNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default.allow-tcp-6379
  namespace: default
spec:
  tier: default
  selector: role == 'database'
  types:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: role == 'frontend'
      destination:
        ports:
          - 6379
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

**Example: StagedKubernetesNetworkPolicy**

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: StagedKubernetesNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-network-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
            except:
              - 172.17.1.0/24
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              project: myproject
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              role: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 6379
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5978
```

### Preview policy impact

The impact of staged policies are reflected in the _enforced_ field of the generated [flow logs] (link to flow logs details) in Whisker. This field show what would happen to traffic if a staged policy is enforced.

### Enforce a staged policy

When the result of a staged policy is satisfactory, create an identical policy and apply it.
