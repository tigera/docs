# Calico Open Source 3.30 release notes

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of $[prodname].

## New features and enhancements

### Introducing Calico Whisker (tech preview)

This release includes Calico Whisker, a new observability tool that helps you see and understand your network activity.
Whisker is a web console that provides a user-friendly interface for viewing flow logs.

Backed by the new flow logs API, this console displays a stream of aggregated connection data that you can use to monitor and troubleshoot your network.

For more information, see [View flow logs in Calico Whisker](../observability/view-flow-logs.mdx).

### Flow logs API (tech preview)

The flow logs API, which backs the Calico Whisker web console, is a gRPC API that provides aggregated network traffic data, including policy enforcement details and statistics like packet and byte counts.
You can use the API directly through your own applications or scripts.

For more information, refer to the specifications outlined in [the Protocol Buffers file](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/goldmane/proto/api.proto).

### Staged network policies

You can now use staged network policies to test network policies before applying them to your production environment.
To do this, create a `StagedNetworkPolicy` (or `StagedGlobalNetworkPolicy` or `StagedKubernetesNetworkPolicy`) resource with the policy specifications you want to test.
Next, open a flow log in Whisker to see how the policy would have affected your network traffic, had it been enforced.
When you're happy with the results, you can apply the policy with the appropriate non-staged resource name.

For more information, see [Staged network policies](../network-policy/staged-network-policies.mdx).

### Calico Ingress Gateway (tech-preview)

$[prodname] now includes the ability to deploy Calico Ingress Gateway which is an Enterprise hardened, 100% upstream distribution of Envoy Gateway.
Envoy Gateway is an implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API with several extensions that provide advanced security and traffic management features.

For more information, see [Configure an ingress gateway](../networking/gateway-api.mdx).

### IPAM for load balancers

$[prodname] now extends its IPAM capabilities to support service LoadBalancer IP allocation, providing a centralized, automated approach to managing LoadBalancer IPs within Kubernetes clusters.

For more information, see [LoadBalancer IP address management](../networking/ipam/service-loadbalancer.mdx)

### Improvements to host endpoint protection

You are now able to create and manage custom host endpoints for nodes, based on user-specified templates.
Previously, host endpoints applied to all node interfaces, regardless of need.
Now, you can choose exactly which interfaces are protected by Calico policy.
These templates can be used with automatic host endpoint creation.

For more information, see [Use custom templates for host endpoints](../network-policy/hosts/kubernetes-nodes.mdx#use-custom-templates-for-host-endpoints).

### Quality of Service controls

You can now configure Quality of Service (QoS) controls for Calico workloads by using Kubernetes pod annotations.
These controls allow you to limit ingress and egress bandwidth, packet rate, and the maximum number of established connections for individual pods.
This helps prevent resource overuse by specific workloads and ensures fair network resource allocation across your cluster.
This feature is currently supported only in iptables and nftables modes.

For more information, see [Configure QoS controls](../networking/configuring/qos-controls.mdx).

### BGP Peering for nested KubeVirt clusters

Configure direct BGP peering between your Calico parent cluster and nested Kubernetes clusters running within KubeVirt VMs.
This extends layer 3 network reachability from nested pods to your physical infrastructure, avoiding network overlays and associated overhead.
Setup involves standard Calico BGP resources (BGPPeer, BGPFilter) for eBGP peering and requires KubeVirt's bridged networking mode.

For more information, see [Configure BGP peering with nested clusters running on KubeVirt VMs](../networking/configuring/bgp-to-workload.mdx).

### Default tier policy naming changes

In previous versions, there were inconsistencies in how default tier policies were named and managed, particularly affecting users using CI/CD tools.

Starting with version 3.30.0, we have addressed these inconsistencies.
Users can now create policies in the default tier with or without the `default.` prefix.
However, policies must be managed using the exact name they were created with.
The API server will now consistently return the policy name as it was originally created (with or without the prefix).
If you upgraded from a previous version of Calico, all policies in the default tier will be treated as if they were created with the `default.` prefix.
This change ensures compatibility with CI/CD tools like ArgoCD.

### OpenStack Carakal support

This release adds support for OpenStack Carakal.

### Kubernetes 1.32 and 1.33 support

This release adds support for Kubernetes versions 1.32 and 1.33.

Calico Open Source release 3.30.0 is now generally available.

#### Updating

:::info[Update note]

Updating your cluster to Calico Open Source 3.30 will not automatically enable the flow logs API or the Calico Whisker web console.
To enable these features, you must apply the `Goldmane` and `Whisker` custom resources.

For more information, see [Enable flow logs](../observability/enable-whisker.mdx).
