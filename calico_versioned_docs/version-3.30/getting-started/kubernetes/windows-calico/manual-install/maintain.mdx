# Manage and maintain manually installed Calico for Windows services

:::note

The manual method for installing $[prodnameWindows] is deprecated in favor of using [the Operator and Windows HostProcess containers (HPC)](../operator.mdx#install-calico-for-windows-using-the-operator). Support for this method will be dropped in a future $[prodname] version.

:::

## Big picture

Start, stop, and update $[prodnameWindows] services on the Linux control plane node, and uninstall for $[prodnameWindows].

## How to

### Start and stop $[prodnameWindows] services

- Install and boot $[prodnameWindows]: `install-calico.ps1`
- Start $[prodnameWindows] services:`start-calico.ps1`
- Stop $[prodnameWindows] services: `stop-calico.ps1`

### Update $[prodname] services

To change the parameters defined in `config.ps1`:

- Run `uninstall-calico.ps1` to remove $[prodnameWindows] service configuration
- Modify the configuration
- Run `install-calico.ps1`to reinstall $[prodnameWindows].

Because `config.ps1` is imported by the various component startup scripts, additional environment variables can be added, as documented in the [$[prodname] reference guide](../../../../reference/index.mdx).

### Update service wrapper configuration

The `nssm` command supports changing a number of configuration options for the $[prodname] services. For example, to adjust the maximum size of the Felix log file before it is rotated:

```powershell
nssm set CalicoFelix AppRotateBytes 1048576
```

### Uninstall $[prodnameWindows] from Windows nodes

The following steps removes $[prodnameWindows] (for example to change configuration), but keeps the cluster running.

1. Remove all pods from the Windows nodes.
1. On each Windows node, run the uninstall script:

   ```powershell
   $[rootDirWindows]\uninstall-calico.ps1
   ```

   :::note

   If you are uninstalling to change configuration, make sure that you run the uninstall script with the old configuration file.

### Uninstall kubelet and kube-proxy services from Windows nodes

The following steps uninstall kubelet/kube-proxy services if they were installed by running `$[rootDirWindows]\kubernetes\install-kube-services.ps1`.

1. Remove all pods from the Windows nodes.
1. On each Windows node, run the uninstall script:

   ```
   $[rootDirWindows]\kubernetes\uninstall-kube-services.ps1
   ```

1. If desired, delete the `$[rootDirWindows]` directory.
