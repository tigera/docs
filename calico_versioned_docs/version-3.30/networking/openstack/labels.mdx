# Endpoint labels and operator policy

When $[prodname] represents an OpenStack VM as a $[prodname] WorkloadEndpoint,
it puts labels on the WorkloadEndpoint to identify the project, network, security
groups and namespace that the VM belongs to. The deployment operator can use these
labels to configure $[prodname] policy that is additional to the policy defined
by OpenStack security groups, and that cannot be overridden by user-level security
group config.

## VM endpoint labels

For the VM's OpenStack project (previously known as 'tenant') and network, those
labels are:

| Label Name                                        | Value                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `projectcalico.org/openstack-project-id`          | `<the VM's project ID>`          |
| `projectcalico.org/openstack-project-name`        | `<the VM's project name>`        |
| `projectcalico.org/openstack-project-parent-id`   | `<the VM's parent project ID>`   |
| `projectcalico.org/openstack-network-name`        | `<the VM's network name>`        |

For each security group that the VM belongs to, those labels are:

| Label Name                                                    | Value                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `sg.projectcalico.org/openstack-<security group ID>`          | `<security group ID>`     |
| `sg-name.projectcalico.org/openstack-<security group name>`   | `<security group name>`   |

For the VM's $[prodname] namespace, the label is:

| Label Name                        | Value                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `projectcalico.org/namespace`     | `<namespace name>`     |

When `[calico] openstack_region` has been configured in `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf` (as
recommended for [multiple region deployments](multiple-regions.mdx)) the namespace will be
"openstack-region-" followed by the configured region name. Otherwise it is simply
"openstack".

:::note

To allow $[prodname] to provide the project name and parent ID labels,
you must give Neutron the 'admin' role within your cluster:

```
openstack role add --project service --user neutron admin
```

or some equivalent privilege that allows the Neutron server to do admin-level queries of
the Keystone database. This is because $[prodname]'s driver runs as part of the
Neutron server, and needs to query the Keystone database for the information for those
labels. If Neutron isn't sufficiently privileged, $[prodname] will fall back to
not generating those labels.

:::

:::note

$[prodname] only allows certain characters in label names and values
(alphanumerics, '-', '\_', '.' and '/'), so if a project or security group name normally
has other characters, those will be replaced here by '\_'. Also there is a length
limit, so particularly long names may be truncated.

:::

:::note

$[prodname] does not support changing project name or security group
name for a given ID associated with a VM after the VM has been created. It is
recommended that operators avoid any possible confusion here by not changing project
name for a particular project ID or security group name for particular security group
ID, post-creation.

## Configuring operator policy

Configuring operator policy requires the `calicoctl` executable, so you should
[install](../../operations/calicoctl/install.mdx) and
[configure calicoctl](../../operations/calicoctl/configure/overview.mdx)
 if you
haven't done so already.

- Calico for OpenStack deployments use an etcd datastore, so you should follow the
  instructions for an etcd datastore.

- The settings you need for etcd endpoints, and TLS credentials if your deployment uses
  those, should match what you have in your
  [`neutron.conf`](configuration.mdx)
  and [Felix](../../reference/felix/configuration.mdx)
  configurations.

## Example

Now you can configure $[prodname] operator policy that will apply before the policy
that is derived from OpenStack security groups. For example, to prevent any possible
communication between the "superman" and "lexluthor" projects, you could configure the
following.

```bash
calicoctl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-lexluthor-to-superman
spec:
  order: 10
  selector: "projectcalico.org/openstack-project-name == 'superman'"
  types:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - action: Deny
    source:
      selector: "projectcalico.org/openstack-project-name == 'lexluthor'"
---
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-superman-to-lexluthor
spec:
  order: 10
  selector: "projectcalico.org/openstack-project-name == 'lexluthor'"
  types:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - action: Deny
    source:
      selector: "projectcalico.org/openstack-project-name == 'superman'"
EOF
```

:::note

$[prodname] will enforce any policy with a specified `order` field (as
here) before any policy derived from OpenStack security groups.
