# Network set

A network set resource (NetworkSet) represents an arbitrary set of IP subnetworks/CIDRs,
allowing it to be matched by {{prodname}} policy. Network sets are useful for applying policy to traffic
coming from (or going to) external, non-{{prodname}}, networks.

`NetworkSet` is a namespaced resource. `NetworkSets` in a specific namespace
only applies to [network policies](networkpolicy.mdx)
in that namespace. Two resources are in the same namespace if the `namespace`
value is set the same on both. (See [GlobalNetworkSet](globalnetworkset.mdx) for non-namespaced network sets.)

The metadata for each network set includes a set of labels. When {{prodname}} is calculating the set of
IPs that should match a source/destination selector within a
[network policy](networkpolicy.mdx) rule, it includes
the CIDRs from any network sets that match the selector.

:::note

Since {{prodname}} matches packets based on their source/destination IP addresses,
{{prodname}} rules may not behave as expected if there is NAT between the {{prodname}}-enabled node and the
networks listed in a network set. For example, in Kubernetes, incoming traffic via a service IP is
typically SNATed by the kube-proxy before reaching the destination host so {{prodname}}'s workload
policy will see the kube-proxy's host's IP as the source instead of the real source.
For `calicoctl` commands that specify a resource type on the CLI, the following
aliases are supported (all case-insensitive): `networkset`, `networksets`, `netsets`.
