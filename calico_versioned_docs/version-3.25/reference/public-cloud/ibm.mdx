# IBM Cloud

{{prodname}} is installed and configured automatically in your [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/products/kubernetes-service/). Default policies are created to protect your Kubernetes cluster, with the option to create your own policies to protect specific services.

## IP-in-IP encapsulation

[IP-in-IP encapsulation](../../networking/configuring/vxlan-ipip.mdx) is automatically configured to only encapsulate packets traveling across subnets, and uses NAT for outgoing connections from your containers.

## Enabling workload-to-WAN traffic

This is also handled automatically in the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/products/kubernetes-service/). No additional configuration of Calico is necessary.
