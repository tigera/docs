# Encrypt in-cluster pod traffic

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Big picture

Enable WireGuard to secure on-the-wire, in-cluster pod traffic in a {variables.prodname} cluster.

## Value

When this feature is enabled, {variables.prodname} automatically creates and manages WireGuard tunnels between nodes providing transport-level security for on-the-wire, in-cluster pod traffic. WireGuard provides [formally verified](https://www.wireguard.com/formal-verification/) secure and [performant tunnels](https://www.wireguard.com/performance/) without any specialized hardware. For a deep dive in to WireGuard implementation, see this [white paper](https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf).

{variables.prodname} supports WireGuard encryption for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. These can be independently enabled in the FelixConfiguration resource: `wireguardEnabled`
enables encrypting IPv4 traffic over an IPv4 underlay network and `wireguardEnabledV6` enables encrypting IPv6 traffic over an IPv6 underlay network.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following {variables.prodname} features:

- **Felix configuration resource** with WireGuard configuration parameters

## Before you begin...

**Terminology**

 - Inter-node pod traffic: Traffic leaving a pod from one node destined to a pod on another node
 - Inter-node, host-network traffic: traffic generated by the node itself or a host-networked-pod destined to another node or host-networked-pod
 - Same-node pod traffic: Traffic between pods on the same node

The following platforms:

- Kubernetes, on-premises
- EKS using Calico CNI
- EKS using AWS CNI
- AKS using Azure CNI

**Supported encryption**

- Encryption for inter-node pod traffic
- Encryption for inter-node, host-network traffic - supported only on managed clusters deployed on EKS and AKS

**Required**

- On all nodes in the cluster that you want to participate in {variables.prodname} encryption, verify that the operating system(s) on the nodes are [installed with WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).

  :::note

  Some node operating systems do not support Wireguard, or do not have it installed by default. Enabling {variables.prodname} Wireguard encryption does not require all nodes to be installed with Wireguard. However, traffic to or from a node that does not have Wireguard installed will not be encrypted.

  :::

- IP addresses for every node in the cluster. This is required to establish secure tunnels between the nodes. {variables.prodname} can automatically do this using [IP autodetection methods](../networking/ipam/ip-autodetection.mdx).

### Install WireGuard

WireGuard is included in Linux 5.6+ kernels, and has been backported to earlier Linux kernels in some Linux distributions.

Install WireGuard on cluster nodes using [instructions for your operating system](https://www.wireguard.com/install/). Note that you may need to reboot your nodes after installing WireGuard to make the kernel modules available on your system.

Use the following instructions for these platforms that are not listed on the WireGuard installation page, before proceeding to [enabling WireGuard](#enable-wireguard-for-a-cluster).

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="EKS" value="EKS-0">

To install WireGuard on the default Amazon Machine Image (AMI):

```bash
   sudo yum install kernel-devel-`uname -r` -y
   sudo yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm -y
   sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/jdoss-wireguard-epel-7.repo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/jdoss/wireguard/repo/epel-7/jdoss-wireguard-epel-7.repo
   sudo yum install wireguard-dkms wireguard-tools -y
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="AKS" value="AKS-1">

AKS cluster nodes run Ubuntu with a kernel that has WireGuard installed already, so there is no manual installation required.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="OpenShift" value="OpenShift-2">

To install WireGuard for OpenShift v4.8:

1.  Install requirements:

    - [CoreOS Butane](https://coreos.github.io/butane/getting-started/)
    - [Openshift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html)

1.  Download and configure the tools needed for kmods.

```bash
FAKEROOT=$(mktemp -d)
git clone https://github.com/tigera/kmods-via-containers
cd kmods-via-containers
make install FAKEROOT=${FAKEROOT}
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/tigera/kvc-wireguard-kmod
cd kvc-wireguard-kmod
make install FAKEROOT=${FAKEROOT}
cd ..
```

1.  Configure/edit `${FAKEROOT}/root/etc/kvc/wireguard-kmod.conf`.

    a. You must then set the URLs for the `KERNEL_CORE_RPM`, `KERNEL_DEVEL_RPM` and `KERNEL_MODULES_RPM` packages in the conf file `$FAKEROOT/etc/kvc/wireguard-kmod.conf`. Obtain copies for `kernel-core`, `kernel-devel`, and `kernel-modules` rpms from [RedHat Access](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/package-browser) and host it in an http file server that is reachable by your OCP workers.

    b. For help configuring `kvc-wireguard-kmod/wireguard-kmod.conf` and Wireguard version to kernel version compatibility, see the [kvc-wireguard-kmod README file](https://github.com/tigera/kvc-wireguard-kmod#quick-config-variables-guide).

1.  Get RHEL Entitlement data from your own RHEL8 system from a host in your cluster.

    ```bash
    tar -czf subs.tar.gz /etc/pki/entitlement/ /etc/rhsm/ /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo
    ```

    Please refer to Openshift [documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_subscription_management/1/html-single/rhsm/index#reg-cli) for more information about these entitlement files.

1.  Copy the `subs.tar.gz` file to your workspace and then extract the contents using the following command.

    ```bash
    tar -x -C ${FAKEROOT}/root -f subs.tar.gz
    ```

1.  Transpile your machine config using [CoreOS Butane](https://coreos.github.io/butane/getting-started/).

    ```bash
    cd kvc-wireguard-kmod
    make ignition FAKEROOT=${FAKEROOT} > mc-wg.yaml
    ```

1.  With the KUBECONFIG set for your cluster, run the following command to apply the MachineConfig which will install WireGuard across your cluster.
    ```bash
    oc create -f mc-wg.yaml
    ```

### Enable WireGuard for a cluster

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Operator" value="Operator-3">

Enable IPv4 WireGuard encryption across all the nodes using the following command.

```bash
kubectl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabled":true}}'
```

Enable IPv6 WireGuard encryption across all the nodes using the following command.

```bash
kubectl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabledV6":true}}'
```

To enable both IPv4 and IPv6 WireGuard encryption across all the nodes, use the following command.

```bash
kubectl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabled":true,"wireguardEnabledV6":true}}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Manifest" value="Manifest-4">

Enable IPv4 WireGuard encryption across all the nodes using the following command.

```bash
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabled":true}}'
```

Enable IPv6 WireGuard encryption across all the nodes using the following command.

```bash
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabledV6":true}}'
```

To enable both IPv4 and IPv6 WireGuard encryption across all the nodes, use the following command.

```bash
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabled":true,"wireguardEnabledV6":true}}'
```

**Perform the next step for EKS and AKS clusters only, and only if your cluster is using the cloud provider CNI plugin and not Calico CNI.** Enable WireGuard encryption for direct node-to-node communications using the following command.

```bash
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec": {"wireguardHostEncryptionEnabled": true}}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For OpenShift, add the Felix configuration with WireGuard enabled [under custom resources](../getting-started/kubernetes/openshift/installation.mdx#optionally-provide-additional-configuration).

:::note

The above command can be used to change other WireGuard attributes. For a list of other WireGuard parameters and configuration evaluation, see the [Felix configuration](../reference/resources/felixconfig.mdx#felix-configuration-definition).

:::

:::note

`natOutgoing: true` is set for the default IPv4 IP pool, but not so for IPv6. Wireguard requires `natOutgoing` to be enabled in both IPv4 and IPv6, so [enable NAT outgoing for the IPv6 IP pools](../networking/configuring/workloads-outside-cluster.mdx) when using IPv6 Wireguard.

:::

We recommend that you review and modify the MTU used by {variables.prodname} networking when WireGuard is enabled to increase network performance. Follow the instructions in the [Configure MTU to maximize network performance](../networking/configuring/mtu.mdx) guide to set the MTU to a value appropriate for your network.

### Disable WireGuard for an individual node

To disable WireGuard on a specific node with WireGuard installed, modify the node-specific Felix configuration. e.g., to turn off encryption for pod traffic on node `my-node`, use the following command. This command disables WireGuard for both IPv4 and IPv6, modify it accordingly if disabling only either IP version:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: FelixConfiguration
metadata:
  name: node.my-node
spec:
  logSeverityScreen: Info
  reportingInterval: 0s
  wireguardEnabled: false
  wireguardEnabledV6: false
EOF
```

With the above command, {variables.prodname} will not encrypt any of the pod traffic to or from node `my-node`.

To enable encryption for IPv4 and IPv6 inter-node pod traffic on node `my-node` again, patch this node's FelixConfiguration (modify accordingly if only dealing with IPv4 or IPv6):

```bash
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration node.my-node --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabled":true,"wireguardEnabledV6":true}}'
```

### Verify configuration

To verify that the nodes are configured for WireGuard encryption, check the node status set by Felix using `calicoctl`. For example:

```bash
     calicoctl get node <NODE-NAME> -o yaml
   ...
   status:
     ...
     wireguardPublicKey: jlkVyQYooZYzI2wFfNhSZez5eWh44yfq1wKVjLvSXgY=
     wireguardPublicKeyV6: hTnWXGM4qk/Z8fQgyGFdpPd4qM9QGR2ey30s31yC6g4=
     ...
```

### Disable WireGuard for a cluster

To disable WireGuard on all nodes modify the default Felix configuration. For example:

```bash
  calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabled":false,"wireguardEnabledV6":false}}'
```
