# Calico the hard way

## About this tutorial

The "Hard Way" is a tutorial for learning how Kubernetes and {variables.prodname} components fit together. The name “{variables.prodname} the hard way” is inspired by [Kubernetes the hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) by Kelsey Hightower. This tutorial is optimized for learning what happens “under the hood,” and uses manifests for installation. **The steps are not suitable for production installs**.

For the most direct path to a production-ready {variables.prodname} install, see our [install guides](../self-managed-onprem/onpremises.mdx).

## Target Audience

This guide is for someone

- evaluating Kubernetes networking & security options looking to deep dive, or
- planning to build and support a {variables.prodname} cluster in production, wanting to understand how it works

This guide assumes proficiency with either AWS web console or CLI for provisioning and accessing nodes.

## Cluster Details

{variables.prodname} runs in many environments and supports many cluster types. To keep things reasonably prescriptive this guide focuses on Kubernetes running on AWS, but the lessons you learn apply to wherever you choose to run {variables.prodname}. See Getting Started for a full list of cluster types (OpenShift, OpenStack, etc.).

The guide will help you install a cluster with the following {variables.prodname} options

- Kubernetes as the datastore
- {variables.prodname} CNI plugin, with BGP networking
- {variables.prodname} IP address management (IPAM)
- No overlays
- IPv4 addresses
- Highly available Typha with mutually authenticated TLS
