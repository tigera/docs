# Install Calico for policy and flannel (aka Canal) for networking

## Before you begin

:::note

Calico includes native VXLAN capabilities without the need for flannel. If you're planning on using flannel for VXLAN, we recommend instead installing Calico using IP-in-IP or VXLAN mode. See how to [determine the best networking option](../../../networking/determine-best-networking.mdx) for your cluster.
If you're already using flannel for networking, you can [migrate your existing clusters to Calico networking](migration-from-flannel.mdx).

:::

Ensure that you have a Kubernetes cluster that meets the
{{prodname}} [system requirements](../requirements.mdx). If you don't,
follow the steps in [Installing kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/).

## Installing {{prodname}} for policy and flannel (aka Canal) for networking

### Selecting a datastore type

The procedure differs according to your datastore type. Refer to the section that matches your type.

- [Kubernetes API datastore](#installing-with-the-kubernetes-api-datastore-recommended) (recommended)

- [etcd datastore](#installing-with-the-etcd-datastore)

### Installing with the Kubernetes API datastore (recommended)

1. Ensure that the Kubernetes controller manager has the following flags
   set: <br/>
   `--cluster-cidr=<your-pod-cidr>` and `--allocate-node-cidrs=true`.

   :::tip

   On kubeadm, you can pass `--pod-network-cidr=<your-pod-cidr>`
   to kubeadm to set both Kubernetes controller flags.

   :::

1. Download the flannel networking manifest for the Kubernetes API datastore.

   ```bash
   curl {{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/canal.yaml -O
   ```

1. If your cluster is configured to use pod CIDR `10.244.0.0/16`, skip to the next step.
   If your cluster is configured to use a different pod CIDR, replace `10.244.0.0/16` in the downloaded manifest with the correct pod CIDR.

1. Issue the following command to install {{prodname}}.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f canal.yaml
   ```

1. If you wish to enforce application layer policies and secure workload-to-workload
   communications with mutual TLS authentication, continue to [Enable application layer policy](../../../network-policy/istio/app-layer-policy.mdx) (optional).

The geeky details of what you get:

<GeekDetails
  prodname='{{prodname}}'
  details='Policy:Calico,IPAM:Host-local,CNI:Calico,Overlay:VXLAN,Routing:Static,Datastore:Kubernetes'
/>

### Installing with the etcd datastore

We strongly recommend using the Kubernetes API datastore, but if you prefer to use
etcd, complete the following steps.

1. Download the {{prodname}} networking manifest.

   ```bash
   curl {{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/canal-etcd.yaml -O
   ```

1. If your cluster is configured to use pod CIDR `10.244.0.0/16`, skip to the next step.
   If your cluster is configured to use a different pod CIDR, replace `10.244.0.0/16` in the downloaded manifest with the correct pod CIDR.

1. In the `ConfigMap` named `calico-config`, set the value of
   `etcd_endpoints` to the IP address and port of your etcd server.

   :::tip

   You can specify more than one using commas as delimiters.

   :::

1. Apply the manifest using the following command.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f canal-etcd.yaml
   ```

1. If you wish to enforce application layer policies and secure workload-to-workload
   communications with mutual TLS authentication, continue to [Enable application layer policy](../../../network-policy/istio/app-layer-policy.mdx) (optional).

<GeekDetails
  prodname='{{prodname}}'
