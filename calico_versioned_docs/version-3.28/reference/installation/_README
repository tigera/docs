# Generating API reference docs

The _api.md doc in this directory is generated using https://github.com/elastic/crd-ref-docs/

To generate an updated file, change to the root of the docs repository and run
the appropriate Makefile target `make build-crd-reference-docs` passing the correct `PRODUCT`.
See the `README.md` file for more details on how to list available targets and which ones to run.
