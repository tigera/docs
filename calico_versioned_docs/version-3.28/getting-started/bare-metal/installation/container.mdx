description: Install Calico on non-cluster hosts using a Docker container.

# Docker container install

import DockerContainerService from '@site/calico_versioned_docs/version-3.28/_includes/content/_docker-container-service.mdx';

## Big picture

Install $[prodname] on non-cluster hosts using a Docker container for both networking and policy.

## Value

Installing $[prodname] with a Docker container includes everything you need for both networking and policy. It also automatically adds the appropriate per-node configuration to the datastore.

## Before you begin...

1. Ensure Docker is installed
1. Ensure the $[prodname] datastore is up and accessible from the host
1. Ensure the host meets the minimum [system requirements](../requirements.mdx)

## How to

The `$[nodecontainer]` container should be started at boot time by your init system and the init system must be configured to restart it if stopped. $[prodname] relies on that behavior for certain configuration changes.
