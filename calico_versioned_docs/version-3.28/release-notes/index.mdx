# Calico Open Source 3.28 release notes

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of $[prodname].

## New features and enhancements

### Configure multiple IP pools during installation

You can now configure multiple IP pools when you install Calico on your clusters.
Specifying multiple IP pools during installation is important for clusters where IP address assignment is tied to the topology of the cluster.
This can be helpful, for example, when IP pools are assigned to particular nodes, racks, or availability zones in order to satisfy internal policy or firewalling restrictions.

For more information, see [Create multiple IP pools](../networking/ipam/ippools.mdx).

### Delay pod Ready status until after network policies are rendered

This update lets you prevent new pods from moving to a ready status until after their network policies have finished rendering.
In some high-churn environments, pods may be deployed and marked as ready before network policies have been rendered, causing problems when traffic to those pods is denied.
The new `policy_setup_timeout_seconds` configuration option allows you build in a delay to give those polices time to finish processing.

You may find this option useful if you're running traditional applications that assume resiliency in the architecture.

For more information, see [Enabling policy setup timeout](../reference/configure-cni-plugins.mdx#enabling-policy-setup-timeout).

### IPv6 support for eBPF mode is generally available

Calico Open Source 3.28 introduces full support for IPv6 for clusters using the eBPF data plane.

For more information, see [Enable the eBPF dataplane](../operations/ebpf/enabling-ebpf.mdx) and [Configure dual stack or IPv6 only](../networking/ipam/ippools.mdx).

### Enhancements

- We made it easier to migrate your cluster from iptables to eBPF data plan modes.
  Previously, having a mix of nodes in iptables and eBPF modes could cause a breakdown in cluster networking.
  Now, the operator makes the transition with minimal disruption.
- We improved how Felix calculates rules in situations where there are high numbers (up to 200) of shared policies per endpoint.
  Depending on the number of shared policies, this can reduce the number of rules per pod by several hundred.
  These improvements apply only when Calico is running in iptables mode.
- Re-enable VXLAN checksum offload for kernels > 5.7 (takes effect when nodes are restarted). [calico #8774](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8774) (@tomastigera)
- Calico is now built with Go 1.22.3 against Kubernetes v1.28.7. Moving to Go 1.22 fixed a couple of latent bugs, detected by the new for loop semantics. [calico #8717](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8717) (@fasaxc)
- Calico now builds against Kubernetes v1.28.9 [calico #8733](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8733) (@fasaxc)
- Update flannel version to v0.24.3. [calico #8595](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8595) (@laibe)
- Bump iptables version of calico-node to 1.8.8 [calico #8416](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8416) (@cyclinder)
- Bump github.com/containerd/containerd from 1.6.23 to 1.6.26 [calico #8355](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8355) (@dependabot[bot])
- Bump github.com/opencontainers/runc from 1.1.6 to 1.1.12 [calico #8468](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8468) (@dependabot[bot])
- Update upstream CNI plugins and Flannel downloads to latest golang patches [calico #8307](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8307) (@matthewdupre)
- The calico/node-driver-registrar image now has labels for description/maintainers/etc as required by OpenShift certification. [calico #8730](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8730) (@fasaxc)
- Migrate to UBI based go-build [calico #8103](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8103) (@hjiawei)
- Adds options to Felix and the CNI to delay pods going ready until their data plane programming is complete. [calico #8469](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8469) (@aaaaaaaalex)
- Add global +x permissions to endpoint-status dir (#8633) [calico #8641](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8641) (@aaaaaaaalex)
- Typha's typha_breadcrumb_size Prometheus stat now decays to zero if there are no breadcrumbs at all. Previously it would show the last value, or NaN, which were misleading. [calico #8614](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8614) (@fasaxc)
- Update the Grafana dashboard for Typha. Tested with Grafana v10.4.0. [calico #8613](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8613) (@frozenprocess)
- Remove unnecessary FIPS code [calico #8538](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8538) (@rene-dekker)
- Move key-cert-provisioner to the monorepo [calico #8475](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8475) (@rene-dekker)
- Host MTU auto-detection now ignores interfaces that are down. [calico #8496](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8496) (@fasaxc)
- Improve IPAM block garbage collection behavior for IP pools with small blocks. [calico #8454](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8454) (@caseydavenport)
- Clean up: VXLAN ARP and FDB programming is moved to a new sub-component. This should make it easier to maintain. [calico #8449](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8449) (@fasaxc)
- Felix now avoids accessing non-Calico IP sets. This reduces the scope for IP set compatibility errors when another app has created an IP set that Calico's version of IP set can't parse. [calico #8387](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8387) (@mazdakn)
- Move certificates permissions out of the else-block. [calico #8369](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8369) (@rene-dekker)
- Docker images now use COPY instead of ADD as recommended by CIS. Typha no longer relies on the tini init daemon, it handles the common signals internally (and it does not spawn any subprocesses so there is no need for a reaper). [calico #8289](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8289) (@fasaxc)
- Only program failsafe rules for IP version of the CIDR [calico #8286](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8286) (@tomastigera)
- Felix now breaks up "policy jump rules" into new iptables "policy group chains" by selector. If two endpoints share a common sequence of policies they will share the same group chain, which reduces the number of rules that need to be programmed. [calico #8098](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8098) (@fasaxc)
- Felix and Typha now support enabling the Go standard library's debug server via the DebugHost/DebugPort configuration options. This allows process profiling data to be collected more easily. [calico #8091](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8091) (@fasaxc)
- Disable IPIP tunnel checksum offload on kernels &#8804; v5.7 [calico #8031](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8031) (@cyclinder)
- Improve BIRD liveness probe so that it confirms BIRD is responsive over its socket [calico #7556](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/7556) (@caseydavenport)
- Run calico/apiserver as non-root by default [calico #8576](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8576) (@hjiawei)
- Move calicoctl binary to standard executable search path [calico #8364](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8364) (@hjiawei)
- ebpf: wg6 traffic is allowed even if blocked by policy [calico #8755](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8755) (@tomastigera)

- ebpf: XDP v6 requires Linux kernel 5.18+ (Ubuntu >=22.04) [calico #8587](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8587) (@sridhartigera)
- ebpf: host can access self via a service without CTLB [calico #8564](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8564) (@tomastigera)
- ebpf: Support dual stack. [calico #8509](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8509) (@sridhartigera)
- ebpf: projectcalico.org/natExcludeService=true makes kube-proxy to ignore the service. That allows using node local dns cache. [calico #8484](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8484) (@tomastigera)

- Fix that Felix could briefly report "ready" in the middle of initialisation, before going "non-ready" again until the data plane was in-sync. In eBPF mode, Felix will now report non-Ready if it fails to program some BPF programs. Previously, this would only be reported through logging. [calico #8506](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8506) (@fasaxc)

- eBPF: Support many more active policy rules per endpoint+direction. The BPF policy compiler now supports splitting policy programs if they get larger than the kernel would allow. The exact number of policy rules per endpoint depends on the details of the rules but for some real-world examples we see an increase from approximately 2k rules to approx 15k rules per endpoint direction. [calico #8230](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8230) (@fasaxc)
- ebpf: kube-proxy ServiceInternalTrafficPolicy is now GA and setting the gate would generate a warning message. [calico #8213](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8213) (@tomastigera)

- ebpf: When a pod connects via a service to self, ingress traffic is policed as if it's source is the pod and not the host after MASQ [calico #6949](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/6949) (@tomastigera)
- ebpf: Use a label to clean up conntrack to terminating UDP backends [calico #8480](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8480) (@tomastigera)

<!--## Known issues-->

## Updating

:::important

$[prodname] 3.28 contains breaking changes for installations that use the Calico API server.

:::

- **_Breaking change_**: Upgrading $[prodname] will alter the UID of all `projectcalico.org/v3` resources.
  If you're using the Calico API server, you must restart any controllers, including `kube-controller-manager`, that manage these resources after the upgrade.
  This change addresses an issue where duplicate UIDs on different API resources could disrupt Kubernetes garbage collection.
  [calico #8586](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8586) (@caseydavenport)
- This release re-enables VXLAN checksum offload for kernels > 5.7 (this takes effect when nodes are restarted).
  The offload was disabled in the past due to kernel bugs but has substantial performance impact.
  We've been unable to find an environment where this needs to be disabled, so are re-enabling the offload with the intent of proving it works or finding a setup where it doesn't.
  If you encounter problems after upgrading and restarting nodes, please let us know and set `ChecksumOffloadBroken=true` in the FelixConfiguration's `featureDetectOverride` field to restore the previous behavior.
  [calico #8774](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8774) (@tomastigera)
