The flow logs API (also known as Goldmane) is a gRPC API that powers the Calico Whisker web console.
You can use this API to retrieve aggregated network traffic data, which includes policy enforcement details and statistics like packet and byte counts.

For a complete description of the API, including its available endpoints and function definitions, please refer to the specifications outlined in this PROTO file: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/goldmane/proto/api.proto.
