# Configure use of your image registry

## Big picture

Configure $[prodname] to pull images from a registry (public or private).

## Value

In many deployments, installing $[prodname] in clusters from third-party private repos is not an option. $[prodname] offers these public and private registry options, which can be used in any combination:

- **Install from a registry** for use cases like air-gapped clusters, or clusters with bandwidth or security constraints
- **Install from an image path in a registry** if you have pulled $[prodname] images to a sub path in your registry
- [Install images by registry digest](imageset.mdx)

## Concepts

A **container image registry** (often known as a **registry**), is a service where you can push, pull, and store container images. In Kubernetes, a registry is considered _private_ if it is not publicly available.

A **private registry** requires an **image pull secret**. An **image pull secret** provides authentication for an image registry; this allows you to control access to certain images or give access to higher pull rate limits (like with DockerHub).

An **image path** is a directory in a registry that contains images required to install $[prodname].

## Before you begin

**Required**

- $[prodname] is managed by the operator
- Configure pull access to your registry
- If you are using a private registry that requires user authentication, ensure that an image pull secret is configured for your registry in the tigera-operator namespace. Set the environment variable, `REGISTRY_PULL_SECRET` to the secret name. For help, see `imagePullSecrets` and `registry` fields, in [Installation resource reference](../../reference/installation/api.mdx).
- Use the [Crane command](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/README.md) to manage the $[prodnameWindows] images, as using `docker pull` commands for these images may not work depending on the operating system and version in which the commands are run.

## How to

The following examples show the path format for public and private registry, `$REGISTRY/`. If you are using an image path, substitute the format: `$REGISTRY/$IMAGE_PATH/`.

### Push $[prodname] images to your registry

To install images from your registry, you must first pull the images from Tigera's registry, retag them with your own registry, and then push the newly-tagged images to your own registry. Use the `crane cp` command instead of pulling+retagging+pushing on the $[prodnameWindows] images (`node-windows` and `cni-windows`).

### Run the operator using images from your registry

Before applying `tigera-operator.yaml`, modify registry references to use your custom registry:

**For OpenShift**

Download all manifests first, then modify the following:

```bash
sed -ie "s?quay.io?$REGISTRY?g" manifests/02-tigera-operator.yaml
```

**For all other platforms**

```bash
sed -ie "s?quay.io?$REGISTRY?g" tigera-operator.yaml
```

Next, if you are implementing user authentication to access a private registry, add the image pull secret for your `registry` to the secret `tigera-pull-secret`.

```bash
sed -ie "/serviceAccountName: tigera-operator/a \      imagePullSecrets:\n\      - name: $REGISTRY_PULL_SECRET"  tigera-operator.yaml
```

### Configure the operator to use images

Set the `spec.registry` field of your Installation resource to the name of your custom registry. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  variant: Calico
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: tigera-pull-secret
  // highlight-next-line
  registry: myregistry.com
```
