# Start and stop Calico for Windows services

## Big picture

Start, stop, and update {{prodnameWindows}} services on the Linux control plane node, and uninstall for {{prodnameWindows}}.

## How to

### Start and stop {{prodnameWindows}} services

- Install and boot {{prodnameWindows}}: `install-calico.ps1`
- Start {{prodnameWindows}} services:`start-calico.ps1`
- Stop {{prodnameWindows}} services: `stop-calico.ps1`

### Update {{prodname}} services

To change the parameters defined in `config.ps1`:

- Run `uninstall-calico.ps1` to remove {{prodnameWindows}} service configuration
- Modify the configuration
- Run `install-calico.ps1`to reinstall {{prodnameWindows}}.

Because `config.ps1` is imported by the various component startup scripts, additional environment variables can be added, as documented in the [{{prodname}} reference guide](../../../reference/index.mdx).

### Update service wrapper configuration

The `nssm` command supports changing a number of configuration options for the {{prodname}} services. For example, to adjust the maximum size of the Felix log file before it is rotated:

```powershell
nssm set CalicoFelix AppRotateBytes 1048576
```

### Uninstall {{prodnameWindows}} from Windows nodes

The following steps removes {{prodnameWindows}} (for example to change configuration), but keeps the cluster running.

1. Remove all pods from the Windows nodes.
1. On each Windows node, run the uninstall script:

   ```powershell
   {{rootDirWindows}}\uninstall-calico.ps1
   ```

   :::note

   If you are uninstalling to change configuration, make sure that you run the uninstall script with the old configuration file.
