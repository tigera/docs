# Stand up Kubernetes

We will install {{prodname}} on a Kubernetes cluster. To demonstrate a highly available {{prodname}} control plane, we will use five nodes in this guide. This lab walks you through provisioning a Kubernetes cluster in AWS using kubeadm.

## Provision EC2 Nodes

1. Provision five nodes
   1. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - Focal
   1. T2.medium
   1. Ensure the instances are in the same subnet, and security group policy allows them communicate freely with one another.
   1. Disable Source / Destination Checks on the Elastic Network Interface for each instance
1. Install Docker on each node
   1. `sudo apt update`
   1. `sudo apt install docker.io`
   1. `sudo systemctl enable docker`

## Install Kubernetes

1. Install kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl by following [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#installing-kubeadm-kubelet-and-kubectl)
1. Choose one node as your Kubernetes master. On that node
   `sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16`

   The Kubernetes `pod-network-cidr` is the IP prefix for all pods in the Kubernetes cluster. This range must not clash with other networks in your VPC.

1. On all other nodes
   `sudo kubeadm join <output from kubeadm init>`
1. Copy admin credentials
1. Test Access

   1. Run

      `kubectl get nodes`

      Verify all nodes have joined. At this point nodes have joined but they are in `NotReady` state, because Kubernetes can't find a networking provider and configuration.
