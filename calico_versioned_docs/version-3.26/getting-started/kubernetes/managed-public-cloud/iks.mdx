# IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)

## Big picture

Enable $[prodname] in IKS managed Kubernetes service.

## Value

IKS has built-in support for $[prodname], providing a robust implementation of the full Kubernetes Network Policy API. IKS users wanting to go beyond Kubernetes network policy capabilities can make full use of the $[prodname] Network Policy API. In addition to using $[prodname] to secure Kubernetes pods, IKS also uses $[prodname] host endpoint capabilities to provide additional security for the nodes in your cluster.

## How to

$[prodname] networking and network policy are automatically installed and configured in your [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/products/kubernetes-service/). Default policies are created to protect your Kubernetes cluster, with the option to create your own policies to protect specific services.

The geeky details of what you get:

<GeekDetails
  prodname='$[prodname]'
  details='Policy:Calico,IPAM:Calico,CNI:Calico,Cross-subnet:IPIP,Routing:BGP,Datastore:Kubernetes'
/>

## Next steps

**Required**

- [Install calicoctl command line tool](../../../operations/calicoctl/install.mdx)

**Recommended**

- [Controlling traffic with network policies for IKS](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-network_policies)
- [Get started with Kubernetes network policy](../../../network-policy/get-started/kubernetes-policy/kubernetes-network-policy.mdx)
- [Get started with Calico network policy](../../../network-policy/get-started/calico-policy/calico-network-policy.mdx)
