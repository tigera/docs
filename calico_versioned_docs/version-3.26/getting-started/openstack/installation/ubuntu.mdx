description: Install Calico on OpenStack, Ubuntu nodes.
---

# Ubuntu

import OpenStackEtcdAuth from '@site/calico_versioned_docs/version-3.26/_includes/content/_openstack-etcd-auth.mdx';

These instructions will take you through a first-time install of
{{prodname}}. If you are upgrading an existing system, please see
[Upgrading {{prodname}} on OpenStack](../../../operations/upgrading/openstack-upgrade.mdx)
instead.

There are two sections to the install: adding {{prodname}} to OpenStack
control nodes, and adding {{prodname}} to OpenStack compute nodes. Follow
the [Common steps](#common-steps) on each node before moving on to the specific
instructions in the control and compute sections. If you want to create a
combined control and compute node, work through all three sections.

## Before you begin

- Ensure that you meet the [requirements](../requirements.mdx).
- Confirm that you have SSH access to and root privileges on one or more Ubuntu hosts
  (your OpenStack compute or control nodes).
- [Install OpenStack with Neutron and ML2 networking](http://docs.openstack.org)
  on the Ubuntu hosts.

## Common steps

Some steps need to be taken on all machines being installed with {{prodname}}.
These steps are detailed in this section.

1.  Configure APT to use the {{prodname}} PPA:

    ```bash
    add-apt-repository ppa:project-calico/{{ ppa_repo_name }}
    ```

1.  Add the official [BIRD](http://bird.network.cz/) PPA. This PPA contains
    fixes to BIRD that are not yet available in Ubuntu. To add the PPA, run:

    ```bash
    add-apt-repository ppa:cz.nic-labs/bird
    ```

    :::tip

    If the above command fails with error
    `'ascii' codec can't decode byte`, try running the command with a
    UTF-8 enabled locale:
    `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 add-apt-repository ppa:cz.nic-labs/bird`.

    :::

1.  Update your package manager on each machine:

    ```bash
    apt-get update
    ```

1.  Install version 1.0.1 of the `etcd3gw` Python package.  This is
    needed by {{prodname}}'s OpenStack driver and DHCP agent.

    ```
    apt-get install -y python3-pip
    pip3 install etcd3gw==1.0.1
    ```

1.  Edit `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`. Add a `[calico]` section with
    the following content, where `<ip>` is the IP address of the etcd
    server.

    ```
    [calico]
    etcd_host = <ip>
    ```

## Control node install

On each control node, perform the following steps.

1.  Delete all configured OpenStack state, in particular any instances,
    routers, subnets and networks (in that order) created by the install
    process referenced above. You can do this using the web dashboard or
    at the command line.

    :::tip

    The Admin and Project sections of the web dashboard both
    have subsections for networks and routers. Some networks may
    need to be deleted from the Admin section.

    :::

    :::caution

    The {{prodname}} install will fail if incompatible state is
    left around.

    :::

1.  Run `apt-get upgrade` and `apt-get dist-upgrade`. These commands
    bring in {{prodname}}-specific updates to the OpenStack packages and
    to `dnsmasq`.

1.  Edit `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`. In the `[DEFAULT]` section, find
    the line beginning with `core_plugin`, and change it to read `core_plugin = calico`. Also remove any existing setting for `service_plugins`.

1.  Install the `calico-control` package:

    ```
    apt-get install -y calico-control
    ```

1.  Restart the Neutron server process:

    ```
    service neutron-server restart
    ```

## Compute node install

On each compute node, perform the following steps:

1.  Open `/etc/nova/nova.conf` and remove the line from the `[DEFAULT]`
    section that reads:

    ```bash
    linuxnet_interface_driver = nova.network.linux_net.LinuxOVSInterfaceDriver
    ```

    Remove the lines from the `[neutron]` section setting
    `service_neutron_metadata_proxy` or `service_metadata_proxy` to
    `True`, if there are any.

    Restart nova compute.

    ```bash
    service nova-compute restart
    ```

1.  If they're running, stop the Open vSwitch services:

    ```bash
    service openvswitch-switch stop
    service neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent stop
    ```

    Then, prevent the services running if you reboot:

    ```bash
    sh -c "echo 'manual' > /etc/init/openvswitch-switch.override"
    sh -c "echo 'manual' > /etc/init/openvswitch-force-reload-kmod.override"
    sh -c "echo 'manual' > /etc/init/neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent.override"
    ```

    Then, on your control node, run the following command to find the
    agents that you just stopped:

    ```bash
    neutron agent-list
    ```

    For each agent, delete them with the following command on your
    control node, replacing `<agent-id>` with the ID of the agent:

    ```bash
    neutron agent-delete <agent-id>
    ```

1.  Install some extra packages:

    ```bash
    apt-get install -y neutron-common neutron-dhcp-agent nova-api-metadata
    ```

1.  Run `apt-get upgrade` and `apt-get dist-upgrade`. These commands
    bring in {{prodname}}-specific updates to the OpenStack packages and
    to `dnsmasq`.

1.  Edit `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`. In the `[oslo_concurrency]` section,
    ensure that the `lock_path` variable is uncommented and set as follows.

    ```
    # Directory to use for lock files. For security, the specified directory should
    # only be writable by the user running the processes that need locking.
    # Defaults to environment variable OSLO_LOCK_PATH. If external locks are used,
    # a lock path must be set.
    lock_path = $state_path/lock
    ```

1.  Install the {{prodname}} DHCP agent (which uses etcd, allowing
    it to scale to higher numbers of hosts) and disable the Neutron-provided
    one:

    ```
    service neutron-dhcp-agent stop
    echo manual | tee /etc/init/neutron-dhcp-agent.override
    apt-get install -y calico-dhcp-agent
    ```

1.  Install the `calico-compute` package:

    ```bash
    apt-get install -y calico-compute
    ```

    This step may prompt you to save your iptables rules to make them
    persistent on restart -- hit yes.

1.  Configure BIRD. By default {{prodname}} assumes that you will deploy a
    route reflector to avoid the need for a full BGP mesh. To this end, it
    includes configuration scripts to prepare a BIRD config file with a single
    peering to the route reflector. If that's correct for your network, you can
    run either or both of the following commands.

    For IPv4 connectivity between compute hosts:

    ```bash
    calico-gen-bird-conf.sh <compute_node_ip> <route_reflector_ip> <bgp_as_number>
    ```

    And/or for IPv6 connectivity between compute hosts:

    ```bash
    calico-gen-bird6-conf.sh <compute_node_ipv4> <compute_node_ipv6> <route_reflector_ipv6> <bgp_as_number>
    ```

    You will also need to [configure your route reflector to allow connections from the compute node as a route reflector client](../../../networking/configuring/bgp.mdx)
.

    If you _are_ configuring a full BGP mesh you need to handle the BGP
    configuration appropriately on each compute host. The scripts above can be
    used to generate a sample configuration for BIRD, by replacing the
    `<route_reflector_ip>` with the IP of one other compute host -- this will
    generate the configuration for a single peer connection, which you can
    duplicate and update for each compute host in your mesh.

    To maintain connectivity between VMs if BIRD crashes or is upgraded,
    configure BIRD graceful restart:

    - Add `-R` to `BIRD_ARGS` in /etc/bird/envvars (you may need to
      uncomment this option).
    - Edit the upstart jobs /etc/init/bird.conf and bird6.conf (if
      you're using IPv6), and add the following script to it.

      ```bash
      pre-stop script
      PID=`status bird | egrep -oi '([0-9]+)$' | head -n1`
      kill -9 $PID
      end script
      ```

1.  Create `/etc/calico/felix.cfg` with the following content, where `<ip>` is the IP
    address of the etcd server.

    ```conf
    [global]
    DatastoreType = etcdv3
    EtcdAddr = <ip>:2379
    ```

1.  Restart the Felix service.

    ```
    service calico-felix restart
    ```
