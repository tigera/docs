# Host endpoint

import Endpointport from '@site/calico_versioned_docs/version-3.26/_includes/content/_endpointport.mdx';

A host endpoint resource (`HostEndpoint`) represents one or more real or virtual interfaces
attached to a host that is running {{prodname}}. It enforces {{prodname}} policy on
the traffic that is entering or leaving the host's default network namespace through those
interfaces.

- A host endpoint with `interfaceName: *` represents _all_ of a host's real or virtual
  interfaces.

- A host endpoint for one specific real interface is configured by `interfaceName: <name-of-that-interface>`,
  for example `interfaceName: eth0`, or by leaving `interfaceName`
  empty and including one of the interface's IPs in `expectedIPs`.

Each host endpoint may include a set of labels and list of profiles that {{prodname}}
will use to apply
[policy](networkpolicy.mdx)
to the interface.

**Default behavior of external traffic to/from host**

If a host endpoint is created and network policy is not in place, the {{prodname}} default is to deny traffic to/from that endpoint (except for traffic allowed by failsafe rules).
For a named host endpoint (i.e. a host endpoint representing a specific interface), {{prodname}} blocks traffic only to/from the interface specified in the host endpoint. Traffic to/from other interfaces is ignored.

:::note

Host endpoints with `interfaceName: *` do not support [untracked policy](../../network-policy/extreme-traffic/high-connection-workloads.mdx).

:::

For a wildcard host endpoint (i.e. a host endpoint representing all of a host's interfaces), {{prodname}} blocks traffic to/from _all_ interfaces on the host (except for traffic allowed by failsafe rules).

However, profiles can be used in conjunction with host endpoints to modify default behavior of external traffic to/from the host in the absence of network policy.
{{prodname}} provides a default profile resource named `projectcalico-default-allow` that consists of allow-all ingress and egress rules.
Host endpoints with the `projectcalico-default-allow` profile attached will have "allow-all" semantics instead of "deny-all" in the absence of policy.

Note: If you have custom iptables rules, using host endpoints with allow-all rules (with no policies) will accept all traffic and therefore bypass those custom rules.

:::note

Auto host endpoints specify the `projectcalico-default-allow` profile so they behave similarly to pod workload endpoints.

:::

:::note

When rendering security rules on other hosts, {{prodname}} uses the
`expectedIPs` field to resolve label selectors to IP addresses. If the `expectedIPs` field
is omitted then security rules that use labels will fail to match this endpoint.

:::

**Host to local workload traffic**: Traffic from a host to its workload endpoints (e.g. Kubernetes pods) is always allowed, despite any policy in place. This ensures that `kubelet` liveness and readiness probes always work.
