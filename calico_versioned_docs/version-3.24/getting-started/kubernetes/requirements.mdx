# System requirements

<ReqsSys orch='Kubernetes' />

## Kubernetes requirements

#### Supported versions

We test {{prodname}} {{version}} against the following Kubernetes versions.

- v1.22
- v1.23
- v1.24
- v1.25

Due to changes in the Kubernetes API, {{prodname}} {{version}} will not work
on Kubernetes v1.15 or below. v1.16-v1.18 may work, but they are no longer tested.
Newer versions may also work, but we recommend upgrading to a version of {{prodname}}
that is tested against the newer Kubernetes version.

#### CNI plug-in enabled

For Kubernetes 1.24 or later, {{prodname}} must be installed as a CNI plugin in the container runtime.

This installation must use the Kubernetes default CNI configuration directory (`/etc/cni/net.d`) and binary directory (`/opt/cni/bin`).

For Kubernetes 1.23 or earlier, the kubelet must be configured to use CNI networking by passing the `--network-plugin=cni` argument.
(On kubeadm, this is the default.)

#### Other network providers

Generally, you cannot use {{prodname}} together with another network provider.

Notable exceptions include the following:

* [flannel](flannel/index.mdx)
* Platform-specific CNIs, such as the [AWS VPC CNI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/blob/master/README.md) and [Azure VNET CNI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md) plugins.

If you're working with a cluster that already uses another CNI, you cannot migrate to {{prodname}}.

#### Supported kube-proxy modes

{{prodname}} supports the following kube-proxy modes:

- `iptables` (default)
- `ipvs` Requires Kubernetes &#8805;  v1.9.3. Refer to
  [Use IPVS kube-proxy](../../networking/configuring/use-ipvs.mdx) for more details.

#### IP pool configuration

The IP range selected for pod IP addresses cannot overlap with any other
IP ranges in your network, including:

- The Kubernetes service cluster IP range
- The range from which host IPs are allocated

## Application layer policy requirements

- [MutatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook) enabled
- Istio [v1.9](https://istio.io/v1.9/) or [v1.10](https://archive.istio.io/v1.10/)

Note that Kubernetes version 1.16+ requires Istio version 1.2 or greater.
Note that Istio version 1.9 requires Kubernetes version 1.17-1.20.
Note that Istio version 1.10 is supported on Kubernetes version 1.18-1.21, but has been tested on Kubernetes version 1.22.
