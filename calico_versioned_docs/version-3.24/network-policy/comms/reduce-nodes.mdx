# Schedule Typha for scaling to well-known nodes

## Big picture

Schedule Typha to well-known nodes.

## Value

By scheduling Typha to well-known nodes, you can reduce the number of nodes which expose
Typha's listen port.

## Concepts

### Typha

Typha is a {{prodname}} component which improves scalability and reduces the impact that
large clusters may have on the Kubernetes API. Typha agents must accept connections from other agents on a fixed port.

As part of the {{prodname}} bootstrap infrastructure, Typha must be available before
pod networking begins and uses host networking instead. It opens a port on the node it is
scheduled on. By default, it can get scheduled to any node and opens TCP 5473.

## How to

### Tell if you have installed Typha

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Operator" value="Operator-0">

Operator based installations always include Typha.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Manifest" value="Manifest-1">

Check if the `calico-typha` deployment exists in the `kube-system` namespace.

```
kubectl get deployment -n kube-system calico-typha
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Schedule Typha to well-known nodes

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Operator" value="Operator-2">

You can use the Installation API to configure a node affinity for Typha pods. The operator supports both
`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` and `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` options.

For example, to require the scheduler to place Typha on nodes with the label "typha=allowed":

```yaml
kind: Installation
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  typhaAffinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - matchExpressions:
     	- key: typha
          operator: In
          values:
          - allowed
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Manifest" value="Manifest-3">
