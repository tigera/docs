Usage:
  <BINARY_NAME> ipam split <NUMBER> [--cidr=<CIDR>] [--name=<POOL_NAME>] [--config=<CONFIG>] [--allow-version-mismatch]

Options:
  -h --help                    Show this screen.
  -c --config=<CONFIG>         Path to the file containing connection configuration in
                               YAML or JSON format.
                               [default: /etc/calico/calicoctl.cfg]
     --cidr=<CIDR>             CIDR of the IP pool to split.
     --name=<POOL_NAME>        Name of the IP pool to split.
     --allow-version-mismatch  Allow client and cluster versions mismatch.

Description:
  The ipam split command splits an IP pool specified by the specified CIDR or name
  into the specified number of smaller IP pools. Each child IP pool will be of equal
  size. IP pools can only be split into a number of smaller pools that is a power
  of 2.

Examples:
  # Split the IP pool specified by 172.0.0.0/8 into 2 smaller pools
  <BINARY_NAME> ipam split --cidr=172.0.0.0/8 2
```

### Prerequisites

In order to split an IP pool, you will first need to lock the Calico database
so that no IPAM data can change during the split. This is accomplished by using the
[`calicoctl datastore migrate lock` command](../datastore/migrate/lock.mdx).
In order to continue normal IPAM operation, you will need to unlock the calico datastore
after the split with the
[`calicoctl datastore migrate unlock` command](../datastore/migrate/unlock.mdx).

### Examples

Lock the Calico datastore.

```bash
calicoctl datastore migrate lock
```

Split the IP pool specified by 172.0.0.0/15 into 2 smaller pools.

```bash
calicoctl ipam split --cidr=172.0.0.0/15 2
```

This should create 2 IP pools, one covering CIDR `172.0.0.0/16`
and one covering CIDR `172.1.0.0/16`.

Unlock the Calico datastore to restore normal IPAM operation.

```bash
calicoctl datastore migrate unlock
```

### General options

```
  -c --config=<CONFIG>         Path to the file containing connection configuration in
                               YAML or JSON format.
                               [default: /etc/calico/calicoctl.cfg]
```
