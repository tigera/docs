## Big picture

This guide helps you install the `calicoctl` command line tool to manage {{prodname}} resources
and perform administrative functions.

## Value

The `calicoctl` command line tool is required in order to use many of {{prodname}}'s features. It
is used to manage {{prodname}} policies and configuration, as well as view detailed cluster status.

## Concepts

### API groups

All Kubernetes resources belong to an API group. The API group is indicated by the resource's `apiVersion`. For example, {{prodname}}
uses resources in the `projectcalico.org/v3` API group for configuration, and the operator uses resources in the `operator.tigera.io/v1` API group.

You can read more about API groups in [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-groups).

### calicoctl and kubectl

In order to manage {{prodname}} APIs in the `projectcalico.org/v3` API group, you should use `calicoctl`. This is because
`calicoctl` provides important validation and defaulting for these resources that is not available in `kubectl`. However, `kubectl`
should still be used to manage other Kubernetes resources.

:::note

If you would like to use `kubectl` to manage `projectcalico.org/v3` API resources, you can use the
[Calico API server](../install-apiserver.mdx).

:::

:::caution

Never modify resources in the `crd.projectcalico.org` API group directly. These are internal data representations
and modifying them directly may result in unexpected behavior.
In addition to resource management, `calicoctl` also enables other {{prodname}} administrative tasks such as viewing IP pool utilization
and BGP status.

:::

### Datastore

{{prodname}} objects are stored in one of two datastores, either etcd or Kubernetes. The choice of datastore is determined at the time {{prodname}}
is installed. Typically for Kubernetes installations the Kubernetes datastore is the default.

You can run `calicoctl` on any host with network access to the {{prodname}} datastore as either a binary or a container.
For step-by-step instructions, refer to the section that corresponds to your desired deployment.

<!--- Change download URL to latest release if user browsing master branch.  --->

<!--- For master, we hard-code a version since we don't host master releases of calicoctl.  --->

## How to

:::note

Make sure you always install the version of `calicoctl` that matches the version of {{prodname}} running on your cluster.

Verify the plugin works.

```
kubectl calico -h
```

You can now run any `calicoctl` subcommands through `kubectl calico`.

:::note

If you run these commands from your local machine (instead of a host node), some of
the node related subcommands will not work (like node status).

### Install calicoctl as a container on a single host

To install `calicoctl` as a container on a single host, log into the
target host and issue the following command.

```bash
docker pull {{registry}}{{imageNames.calicoctl}}:{{releaseTitle}}
```

### Install calicoctl as a Kubernetes pod

Use the YAML that matches your datastore type to deploy the `calicoctl` container to your nodes.

- **etcd**

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f {{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/calicoctl-etcd.yaml
  ```

  :::note

  You can also
  [view the YAML in a new tab]({{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/calicoctl-etcd.yaml).

  :::

- **Kubernetes API datastore**

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f {{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/calicoctl.yaml
  ```

  :::note

  You can also
  [view the YAML in a new tab]({{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/calicoctl.yaml).

  :::

You can then run commands using kubectl as shown below.

```bash
kubectl exec -ti -n kube-system calicoctl -- /calicoctl get profiles -o wide
```

An example response follows.

```
NAME                 TAGS
kns.default          kns.default
kns.kube-system      kns.kube-system
```

We recommend setting an alias as follows.

```bash
alias calicoctl="kubectl exec -i -n kube-system calicoctl -- /calicoctl"
```

:::note

In order to use the `calicoctl` alias
when reading manifests, redirect the file into stdin, for example:

```bash
calicoctl create -f - < my_manifest.yaml
```

:::

**Next step**:

[Configure `calicoctl` to connect to your datastore](configure/index.mdx).
