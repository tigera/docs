# Calico Open Source 3.29 release notes

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of {{prodname}}.

## New features and enhancements

### Tiered network policy

Tiered network policy makes it easier to manage and enforce network policy.
You can use tiers to group your network policies and create rules to enforce those policies according to what group, or tier, they are part of.
If you have different teams writing network policies, grouping those policies in policy tiers can help ensure that the policies of one team (for example, your security team) aren't overridden by another.

For more information, see [Get started with policy tiers](../network-policy/policy-tiers/tiered-policy.mdx).

### Tech preview: nftables dataplane

This release includes support for the nftables dataplane.

Kubernetes 1.31 introduced a beta status [kube-proxy Service implementation based on nftables](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#proxy-mode-nftables)
that which promises better performance than the default iptables implementation.

Installing Calico Open Sourcce in nftables mode provides a networking and network policy implementation that is compatible with the upstream nftables kube-proxy.

For more information, see [Calico nftables dataplane](../getting-started/kubernetes/nftables.mdx).
