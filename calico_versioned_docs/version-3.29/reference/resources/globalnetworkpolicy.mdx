A global network policy resource (`GlobalNetworkPolicy`) represents an ordered set of rules which are applied
to a collection of endpoints that match a [label selector](#selectors).

`GlobalNetworkPolicy` is not a namespaced resource. `GlobalNetworkPolicy` applies to [workload endpoint resources](workloadendpoint.mdx) in all namespaces, and to [host endpoint resources](hostendpoint.mdx).
Select a namespace in a `GlobalNetworkPolicy` in the standard selector by using
`projectcalico.org/namespace` as the label name and a `namespace` name as the
value to compare against, e.g., `projectcalico.org/namespace == "default"`.
See [network policy resource](networkpolicy.mdx) for namespaced network policy.

`GlobalNetworkPolicy` resources can be used to define network connectivity rules between groups of $[prodname] endpoints and host endpoints, and
take precedence over [Profile resources](profile.mdx) if any are defined.

## Sample YAML

This sample policy allows TCP traffic from `frontend` endpoints to port 6379 on
`database` endpoints.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-tcp-6379
spec:
  selector: role == 'database'
  types:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      metadata:
        annotations:
          from: frontend
          to: database
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: role == 'frontend'
      destination:
        ports:
          - 6379
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

| performanceHints       | Contains a list of hints to Calico's policy engine to help process the policy more efficiently.  Hints never change the enforcement behaviour of the policy.  The available hints are described [below](#performance-hints).         | `AssumeNeededOnEveryNode` | List of strings        |                                               |

\* If `types` has no value, $[prodname] defaults as follows.

> | Ingress Rules Present | Egress Rules Present | `Types` value     |
> | --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
> | No                    | No                   | `Ingress`         |
> | Yes                   | No                   | `Ingress`         |
> | No                    | Yes                  | `Egress`          |
> | Yes                   | Yes                  | `Ingress, Egress` |

\*\* The `doNotTrack` and `preDNAT` and `applyOnForward` fields are meaningful
only when applying policy to a [host endpoint](hostendpoint.mdx).

Only one of `doNotTrack` and `preDNAT` may be set to `true` (in a given policy). If they are both `false`, or when applying the policy to a
[workload endpoint](workloadendpoint.mdx),
the policy is enforced after connection tracking and any DNAT.

`applyOnForward` must be set to `true` if either `doNotTrack` or `preDNAT` is
`true` because for a given policy, any untracked rules or rules before DNAT will
in practice apply to forwarded traffic.

See [Policy for hosts](../../network-policy/hosts/index.mdx)
for how `doNotTrack` and `preDNAT` and `applyOnForward` can be useful for host endpoints.

### Performance Hints

Performance hints provide a way to tell $[prodname] about the intended use of the policy so that it may
process it more efficiently.  Currently only one hint is defined:

* `AssumeNeededOnEveryNode`: normally, $[prodname] only calculates a policy's rules and selectors on nodes where
  the policy is actually in use (i.e. its selector matches a local endpoint).  This saves work in most cases.
  The `AssumeNeededOnEveryNode` hint tells $[prodname] to treat the policy as "in use" on *every* node.  This is
  useful for large policy sets that are known to apply to all (or nearly all) endpoints.  It effectively "preloads"
  the policy on every node so that there is less work to do when the first endpoint matching the policy shows up.
  It also prevents work from being done to tear down the policy when the last endpoint is drained.

## Application layer policy

Application layer policy is an optional feature of $[prodname] and
[must be enabled](../../network-policy/istio/app-layer-policy.mdx)
to use the following match criteria.

:::note

Application layer policy match criteria are supported with the following restrictions.

- Only ingress policy is supported. Egress policy must not contain any application layer policy match clauses.
- Rules must have the action `Allow` if they contain application layer policy match clauses.
