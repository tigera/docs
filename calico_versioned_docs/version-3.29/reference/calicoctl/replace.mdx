# calicoctl replace

This sections describes the `calicoctl replace` command.

Read the [calicoctl command line interface user reference](overview.mdx)
for a full list of calicoctl commands.

:::note

The available actions for a specific resource type may be
limited based on the datastore used for $[prodname] (etcdv3 / Kubernetes API).
Please refer to the
[Resources section](../resources/overview.mdx)
for details about each resource type.

## Displaying the help text for 'calicoctl replace' command

Run `calicoctl replace --help` to display the following help menu for the
command.

```
Usage:
  calicoctl replace --filename=<FILENAME> [--recursive] [--skip-empty] [--config=<CONFIG>] [--namespace=<NS>]

Examples:
  # Replace a policy using the data in policy.yaml.
  calicoctl replace -f ./policy.yaml

  # Replace a policy based on the JSON passed into stdin.
  cat policy.json | calicoctl replace -f -

Options:
  -h --help                  Show this screen.
  -f --filename=<FILENAME>   Filename to use to replace the resource.  If set
                             to "-" loads from stdin. If filename is a directory, this command is
                             invoked for each .json .yaml and .yml file within that directory,
                             terminating after the first failure.
  -R --recursive             Process the filename specified in -f or --filename recursively.
     --skip-empty            Do not error if any files or directory specified using -f or --filename contain no
                             data.
  -c --config=<CONFIG>       Path to the file containing connection
                             configuration in YAML or JSON format.
                             [default: /etc/calico/calicoctl.cfg]
  -n --namespace=<NS>        Namespace of the resource.
                             Only applicable to NetworkPolicy, NetworkSet, and WorkloadEndpoint.
                             Uses the default namespace if not specified.
  --context=<context>        The name of the kubeconfig context to use.

Description:
  The replace command is used to replace a set of resources by filename or
  stdin.  JSON and YAML formats are accepted.

  Valid resource types are:

    - bgpconfiguration
    - bgpfilter
    - bgppeer
    - clusterinformation
    - felixconfiguration
    - globalnetworkpolicy
    - globalnetworkset
    - hostendpoint
    - ippool
    - ipreservation
    - kubecontrollersconfiguration
    - networkpolicy
    - networkset
    - node
    - profile
    - tier
    - workloadendpoint

  Attempting to replace a resource that does not exist is treated as a
  terminating error.

  The output of the command indicates how many resources were successfully
  replaced, and the error reason if an error occurred.

  The resources are replaced in the order they are specified.  In the event of
  a failure replacing a specific resource it is possible to work out which
  resource failed based on the number of resources successfully replaced.

  When replacing a resource, the complete resource spec must be provided, it is
  not sufficient to supply only the fields that are being updated.
```

### Examples

1. Replace a set of resources (of mixed type) using the data in resources.yaml.

   ```bash
   calicoctl replace -f ./resources.yaml
   ```

   Results indicate that 8 resources were successfully replaced.

   ```
   Successfully replaced 8 resource(s)
   ```

1. Replace a policy based on the JSON passed into stdin.

   ```bash
   cat policy.json | calicoctl replace -f -
   ```

   Results indicate the policy does not exist.

   ```
   Failed to replace any 'policy' resources: resource does not exist: Policy(name=dbPolicy)
   ```

### Options

```
-f --filename=<FILENAME>   Filename to use to replace the resource.  If set
                           to "-" loads from stdin.
```

### General options

```
-c --config=<CONFIG>       Path to the file containing connection
                           configuration in YAML or JSON format.
                           [default: /etc/calico/calicoctl.cfg]
```
