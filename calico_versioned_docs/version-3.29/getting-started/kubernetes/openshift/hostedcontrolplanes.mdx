# Install Calico on an OpenShift HCP cluster

import DownloadOpenShiftManifests from '@site/calico_versioned_docs/version-3.29/_includes/components/DownloadOpenShiftManifests.js';

## Big picture

Install $[prodname] on an OpenShift Hosted Control Planes (HCP) cluster.

## Value

Provides steps to install $[prodname] in [OpenShift Hosted Control Planes (HCP)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/hosted_control_planes/index.html) clusters using the [HyperShift](https://github.com/openshift/hypershift) middleware, augmenting the steps in the [HyperShift documentation](https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app) where appropriate.

## How to

### Before you begin

- Ensure that your environment meets the $[prodname] [system requirements](requirements.mdx).

- Ensure that you have a [RedHat account](https://cloud.redhat.com/). A RedHat account is required to get the pull secret necessary to provision an OpenShift cluster. Note that the OpenShift installer supports a subset of AWS regions.

- If installing on AWS, ensure that you have:

    - Configured an AWS account appropriate for OpenShift 4
    - [Set up your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)
    - Generated a local SSH private key and added it to your ssh-agent

- Install the HyperShift CLI and fulfill all the other [Prerequisites from the HyperShift documentation](https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/getting-started/#prerequisites).

### Create the hosting cluster

Deploy an [OpenShift cluster](./installation.mdx) with $[prodname]. This will be the hosting cluster with control-plane nodes for all hosted clusters you deploy with the steps below. Set up your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to your hosting cluster's kubeconfig file:

```
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
```

### Install the HyperShift operator in the hosting cluster

Follow the steps from the HyperShift documentation to [Install the HyperShift Operator](https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/getting-started/#install-hypershift-operator).

### Create a hosted cluster

Create a hosted cluster with $[prodname] by going through the following steps (slightly modified from the [HyperShift docs](https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/how-to/aws/other-sdn-providers/#calico)).

1. Create a HostedCluster and set its HostedCluster.spec.networking.networkType to Other:


:::note
Make sure to adjust the variables for the command below to the correct values for your cluster, credentials and environment.
:::

```
HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME=my-os-hosted-cluster
REGION=us-west-2
BASE_DOMAIN=www.example.com
AWS_CREDS="$HOME/.aws/credentials"
PULL_SECRET="$HOME/.secrets/redhat-pull-secret.txt"

hypershift create cluster aws \
  --name $HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME \
  --node-pool-replicas=3 \
  --base-domain $BASE_DOMAIN \
  --pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
  --aws-creds $AWS_CREDS \
  --region $REGION \
  --generate-ssh \
  --network-type Other
```

:::note
If your hosted cluster is having authorization problems with your Red Hat pull secret (`unauthorized: authentication required` in the HyperShift operator pod logs), make sure it is using a stable release image for the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).
You can find them in [https://amd64.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org], for example `--release-image quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.16.4-x86_64`
:::

:::note
There is currently an [issue](https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/issues/3927) with the HyperShift middleware that will result in the hosted cluster installation not progressing due to a missing `OVNSbDb` service. Patch the hosted cluster resource in order to add it:
```
HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME=my-os-hosted-cluster
CLUSTER_NS="clusters"
oc patch -n ${CLUSTER_NS} hostedcluster ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME} --type='json' -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/services/-", "value": {"service":"OVNSbDb","servicePublishingStrategy": {"type": "Route"}}}]'
```
:::

Once the hosted cluster is up, use the `hypershift` CLI tool to generate the `kubeconfig` file:

```
hypershift create kubeconfig > hosted_kubeconfig && export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/hosted_kubeconfig
```

Then, copy the `aws-creds` secret from the hosting cluster to the hosted cluster. Run this using the hosting cluster kubeconfig to extract the secret to a `yaml` file:

```
oc get secrets --kubeconfig /path/to/hosting/kubeconfig -n kube-system aws-creds -o yaml > aws-creds.yaml
```

Then import it in the hosted cluster:

```
oc apply --kubeconfig /path/to/hosted/kubeconfig -f aws-creds.yaml
```

:::note
There is no need to specify the `--kubeconfig` CLI argument if the hosted cluster's kubeconfig file is configured as the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable in your shell.

### Download the $[prodname] install manifests

Now download and apply the $[prodname] manifests according to the [HyperShift docs](https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/how-to/aws/other-sdn-providers/#calico).

<DownloadOpenShiftManifests />

### Optionally provide additional configuration

You may want to provide Calico with additional configuration at install-time. For example, BGP configuration or peers.
You can use a Kubernetes ConfigMap with your desired Calico resources to set configuration as part of the installation.
If you do not need to provide additional configuration, you can skip this section.

To include [Calico resources](../../../reference/resources/index.mdx) during installation, edit `calico/02-configmap-calico-resources.yaml` to add your own configuration.

:::note
If you have a directory with the Calico resources, you can create the file with the command:

```
oc create configmap -n tigera-operator calico-resources \
--from-file=<resource-directory> --dry-run -o yaml \
calico/02-configmap-calico-resources.yaml
```

With recent versions of oc it is necessary to have a kubeconfig configured or add `--server='127.0.0.1:443'`
even though it is not used.
:::

:::note
If you have provided a `calico-resources` configmap and the tigera-operator pod fails to come up with `Init:CrashLoopBackOff`,
check the output of the init-container with `oc logs -n tigera-operator -l k8s-app=tigera-operator -c create-initial-resources`.
:::

### Apply the $[prodname] install manifests

Apply the install manifests paying attention to the required order:

```
cd calico/
ls *crd*.yaml | xargs -n1 oc apply -f
ls 00* | xargs -n1 oc apply -f
ls 01* | xargs -n1 oc apply -f
ls 02* | xargs -n1 oc apply -f
```

Once the above commands are complete, you can verify $[prodname] is installed by verifying the components are available with the following command.

```
oc get tigerastatus
```

:::note
To get more information, add `-o yaml` to the above command.

## Next steps

**Recommended - Networking**

- If you are using the default BGP networking with full-mesh node-to-node peering with no encapsulation, go to [Configure BGP peering](../../../networking/configuring/bgp.mdx) to get traffic flowing between pods.
- If you are unsure about networking options, or want to implement encapsulation (overlay networking), see [Determine best networking option](../../../networking/determine-best-networking.mdx).

**Recommended - Security**

- [Secure Calico component communications](../../../network-policy/comms/crypto-auth.mdx)
- [Secure hosts by installing Calico on hosts](../../bare-metal/about.mdx)
- [Secure pods with Calico network policy](../../../network-policy/get-started/calico-policy/calico-network-policy.mdx)
- If you are using $[prodname] with Istio service mesh, get started here: [Enable application layer policy](../../../network-policy/istio/app-layer-policy.mdx)
