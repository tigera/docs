# Quickstart for Calico on Kubernetes

## Big picture

This quickstart gets you a single-host Kubernetes cluster with $[prodname] in approximately 15 minutes.

## Value

Use this quickstart to quickly and easily try $[prodname] features. To deploy a cluster suitable for production, refer to [$[prodname] on Kubernetes](../kubernetes/index.mdx).

## Before you begin

**Required**

- A Linux host that meets the following requirements:

  - x86-64, arm64, ppc64le, or s390x processor
  - 2CPU
  - 2GB RAM
  - 10GB free disk space
  - RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.x+, CentOS 7.x+, Ubuntu 18.04+, or Debian 9.x+

- $[prodname] can manage `cali` and `tunl` interfaces on the host

  If NetworkManager is present on the host, see [Configure NetworkManager](../../operations/troubleshoot/troubleshooting.mdx#configure-networkmanager).

## Concepts

### Operator based installation

This quickstart guide uses the Tigera operator to install $[prodname]. The operator provides lifecycle management for Calico
exposed via the Kubernetes API defined as a custom resource definition.

:::note

It is also possible to install Calico without an operator using Kubernetes manifests directly.
For platforms and guides that do not use the Tigera operator, you may notice some differences in the steps and Kubernetes
resources compared to those presented in this guide.

## How to

The geeky details of what you get:

<GeekDetails
  prodname='$[prodname]'
  details='Policy:Calico,IPAM:Calico,CNI:Calico,Overlay:VXLAN,Routing:Calico,Datastore:kubernetes'
/>

### Create a single-host Kubernetes cluster

1. [Follow the Kubernetes instructions to install kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/)

   :::note

   After installing kubeadm, do not power down or restart
   the host. Instead, continue directly to the next step.

   :::

1. As a regular user with sudo privileges, open a terminal on the host that you installed kubeadm on.

1. Initialize the control plane using the following command.

   ```
   sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
   ```

   :::note

   If 192.168.0.0/16 is already in use within your network you must select a different pod network
   CIDR, replacing 192.168.0.0/16 in the above command.

   :::

1. Execute the following commands to configure kubectl (also returned by `kubeadm init`).

   ```
   mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
   sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
   sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
   ```

### Install $[prodname]

1. Install the Tigera $[prodname] operator and custom resource definitions.

   ```
   kubectl create -f $[manifestsUrl]/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
   ```

   :::note

   Due to the large size of the CRD bundle, `kubectl apply` might exceed request limits. Instead, use `kubectl create` or `kubectl replace`.

   :::

1. Install $[prodname] by creating the necessary custom resource. For more information on configuration options available in this manifest, see [the installation reference](../../reference/installation/api.mdx).

   ```
   kubectl create -f $[manifestsUrl]/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
   ```

   :::note

   Before creating this manifest, read its contents and make sure its settings are correct for your environment. For example,
   you may need to change the default IP pool CIDR to match your pod network CIDR.

   :::

1. Confirm that all of the pods are running with the following command.

   ```
   watch kubectl get pods -n calico-system
   ```

   Wait until each pod has the `STATUS` of `Running`.

   :::note

   The Tigera operator installs resources in the `calico-system` namespace. Other install methods may use
   the `kube-system` namespace instead.

   :::

1. Remove the taints on the control plane so that you can schedule pods on it.

   ```bash
   kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane-
   ```

   It should return the following.

   ```
   node/<your-hostname> untainted
   ```

1. Confirm that you now have a node in your cluster with the following command.

   ```
   kubectl get nodes -o wide
   ```

   It should return something like the following.

   ```
   NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION    CONTAINER-RUNTIME
   <your-hostname>   Ready    master   52m   v1.12.2   10.128.0.28   <none>        Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS   4.15.0-1023-gcp   docker://18.6.1
   ```

Congratulations! You now have a single-host Kubernetes cluster with $[prodname].
