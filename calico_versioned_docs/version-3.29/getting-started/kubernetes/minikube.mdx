# Quickstart for Calico on minikube

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Big picture

This quickstart gets you a single-node minikube cluster with $[prodname]
in approximately 1 minute. You can use this cluster for testing and
development.

## Value

Use this quickstart to quickly and easily try $[prodname] features.

## Before you begin

- Install, but do not start, minikube. [How to install minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/#what-youll-need)
- Install kubectl.[How to install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- Install a minikube driver. For example Docker. A full List of available drivers can be [found here.](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/)

## How to

### Create a single-node minikube cluster

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Built-in $[prodname]" value="Built-in $[prodname]-0">

Minikube offers a built-in $[prodname] implementation, this is a quick way to checkout $[prodname] features.

:::note

Enabling preinstalled $[prodname] might be the quickest way for testing. However, if you like to checkout a more recent version or features of $[prodname] you should consider using Manifest or Operator approach.

:::

```bash
minikube start --cni=calico
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Operator" value="Operator-1">

1. Start your minikube cluster with one control plane node using the following command.

   :::note

   If `192.168.0.0/16` is already in use within your network you must select a different pod network CIDR, by replacing `192.168.0.0/16` in the following command.

   :::

   ```bash
   minikube start --cni=false --network-plugin=cni --extra-config=kubeadm.pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16 --subnet=172.16.0.0/24
   ```

2. Install the Tigera $[prodname] operator and custom resource definitions.

   ```bash
   kubectl create -f $[manifestsUrl]/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
   ```

   :::note

   Due to the large size of the CRD bundle, `kubectl apply` might exceed request limits. Instead, use `kubectl create` or `kubectl replace`.

   :::

3. Install $[prodname] by creating the necessary custom resource. For more information on configuration options available in this manifest, see [the installation reference](../../reference/installation/api.mdx).

   :::note

   Before creating this manifest, read its contents and make sure its settings are correct for your environment. For example,
   if you have replaced `pod-network-cidr` you must change it in this file as well.

   :::

   ```bash
   kubectl create -f $[manifestsUrl]/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Manifest" value="Manifest-2">

Start your minikube cluster with one control plane node using the following command:

```bash
minikube start --network-plugin=cni
```

Install $[prodname].

```bash
kubectl apply -f $[manifestsUrl]/manifests/calico.yaml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify $[prodname] installation

Verify $[prodname] installation in your cluster using the following command:

```bash
watch kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=calico-node -A
```

You should see a result similar to the below. Note that the namespace might be different, depending on the method you followed.

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   calico-node-mlqvs   1/1     Running   0          5m18s
```

Use `ctrl+c` to break out of watch.

Congratulations you now have a minikube cluster equipped with $[prodname]

### Add an additional worker node

:::note

This as an optional step, you can safely skip this step if you do not require an additional worker node.

:::

```bash
minikube node add
```

Verify nodes using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Clean up

Delete the cluster using the following command:

```bash
minikube delete
```
