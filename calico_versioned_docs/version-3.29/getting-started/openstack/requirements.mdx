## OpenStack requirements

The Calico Neutron driver is written in Python 3 and so requires an OpenStack release that
runs with Python 3. Subject to that, we aim to develop and maintain the Neutron driver
for {{prodname}} (networking-calico) so that its master code works with OpenStack
master or any previous Python 3 release, on any operating system, independently of the
deployment mechanism that is used to install it.

However, we recommend using OpenStack Yoga or later, and our active support and testing
of {{prodname}} {{version}} with OpenStack is with Yoga.
