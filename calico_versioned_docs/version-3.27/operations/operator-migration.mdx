# Migrate Calico to an operator-managed installation

## Big picture

Switch your {variables.prodname} installation from manifest-based resources to an installation managed by the {variables.prodname} operator.

## Value

The {variables.prodname} operator provides a number of advantages over traditional manifest-based installation of {variables.prodname} resources, including but not limited to:

- Automatic platform and configuration detection.
- A simplified upgrade procedure.
- Well-defined split between end-user configuration and product code.
- Resource reconciliation and lifecycle management.

## Concepts

### Operator vs manifest based installations

Most {variables.prodname} installations in the past have been manifest-based, meaning that {variables.prodname} is installed directly as a set of Kubernetes resources in a `.yaml` file.

The {variables.prodname} operator is a Kubernetes application that installs and manages the lifecycle of a {variables.prodname} installation by creating and updating Kubernetes resources
such as Deployments, DaemonSets, Secrets, without the need for direct user intervention.

There are a few key differences to be aware of, if you are familiar with manifest-based installs and are looking to use the operator:

- {variables.prodname} resources will be migrated from the `kube-system` namespace used by the {variables.prodname} manifests to a new `calico-system` namespace.
- {variables.prodname} resources will no longer be hand-editable, as the {variables.prodname} operator will reconcile undesired changes in order to maintain an expected state.
- {variables.prodname} resources can instead be configured via the `operator.tigera.io` APIs.

### Operator migration

For new clusters, you can simply follow the steps in the [quickstart guide](../getting-started/kubernetes/quickstart.mdx) to get started with the operator.

For existing clusters using the `calico.yaml` manifest to install {variables.prodname}, upon installing the operator, it will detect the existing {variables.prodname} resources on the cluster
and calculate how to take ownership of them. The operator will maintain existing customizations, if supported, and warn about any unsupported configurations that it detects.

## Before you begin

- Ensure that your {variables.prodname} installation is configured to use the Kubernetes datastore. If your cluster uses etcdv3 directly, you must follow [the datastore migration procedure](datastore-migration.mdx) before following this document.
- Migration to {variables.prodname} {variables.version} operator-managed installation is supported only from {variables.prodname} {variables.version} manifest-based installation

## How To

### Migrate a cluster to the operator

:::note

Do not edit or delete any resources in the `kube-system` Namespace during the following procedure as it may interfere with the upgrade.

:::

1. Install the Tigera {variables.prodname} operator and custom resource definitions.

   <CodeBlock language='bash'>
   kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -f {variables.manifestsUrl}/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
   </CodeBlock>

   :::note

   Due to the large size of the CRD bundle, `kubectl apply` might exceed request limits. Instead, use `kubectl create` or `kubectl replace`.

   :::

1. Trigger the operator to start a migration by creating an `Installation` resource. The operator will auto-detect your existing {variables.prodname} settings and fill out the spec section.

   ```bash
   kubectl create -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: Installation
   metadata:
     name: default
   spec: {}
   EOF
   ```

1. Monitor the migration status with the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe tigerastatus calico
   ```

1. Now that the migration is complete, you will see {variables.prodname} resources have moved to the `calico-system` namespace.

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n calico-system
   ```

   You should see output like this:

   ```
   NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   calico-kube-controllers-7688765788-9rqht   1/1     Running   0          17m
   calico-node-4ljs6                          1/1     Running   0          14m
   calico-node-bd8mc                          1/1     Running   0          14m
   calico-node-cpbd8                          1/1     Running   0          14m
   calico-node-jl97q                          1/1     Running   0          14m
   calico-node-xw2nj                          1/1     Running   0          14m
   calico-typha-57bf79f96f-6sk8x              1/1     Running   0          14m
   calico-typha-57bf79f96f-g99s9              1/1     Running   0          14m
   calico-typha-57bf79f96f-qtchs              1/1     Running   0          14m
   ```

   At this point, the operator will have automatically cleaned up any {variables.prodname} resources in the `kube-system` namespace. No manual cleanup is required.
