# Upgrade Calico on OpenShift 4

## About upgrading $[prodname]

This page describes how to upgrade to $[version] for OpenShift 4 from an existing $[prodname] cluster.

<HostEndpointsUpgrade orch='OpenShift' />

## Upgrading Calico on OpenShift 4

Make a manifests directory.

```bash
mkdir manifests
```

<InstallOpenShiftManifests install_type='upgrade' />

Apply the updated manifests.

```bash
oc apply -f manifests/
```

You can now monitor the upgrade progress with the following command:

```bash
watch oc get tigerastatus
```

If you were upgrading from a version of Calico prior to v3.14 and followed the pre-upgrade steps for host endpoints above, review traffic logs from the temporary policy,
add any global network policies needed to allow traffic, and delete the temporary network policy **allow-all-upgrade**.
