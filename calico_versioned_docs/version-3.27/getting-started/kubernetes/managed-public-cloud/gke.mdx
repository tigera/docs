# Install Calico network policy on a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has built-in support for $[prodname], providing a robust implementation of the full Kubernetes Network Policy API.
GKE users wanting to go beyond Kubernetes network policy capabilities can make full use of the $[prodname] Network Policy API.

You can install Calico network policy by enabling it as you create a new GKE cluster.

The geeky details of what you get:

<GeekDetails
  prodname='$[prodname]'
  details='Policy:Calico,IPAM:Host Local,CNI:Calico,Overlay:No,Routing:VPC Native,Datastore:Kubernetes'
/>

## Prerequisites

* You have a Google Cloud account, an active project, and permissions for creating clusters.
* You installed and configured the gcloud and kubectl CLIs on your workstation.

## Create a GKE cluster with Calico enabled for network policy

1. Create a new GKE cluster with network policy by running the following command:

   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters create <cluster-name> --enable-network-policy
   ```

   This may take several minutes to complete.

1. Verify that the Calico pods are running in your cluster by entering the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system
   ```
   Example output:
   ```bash
   NAME                                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

   ```

## Additional resources

For complete GKE requirements, limitations, and other installation methods, see [Enable network policy enforcement](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/network-policy#enabling_network_policy_enforcement).

:::note

GKE documentation does not always refer to Calico by name.
For clusters using Dataplane V1, references to "network policy" often describe integrated Calico network policy.
