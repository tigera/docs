### Big picture

{{site.prodname}} uses the open-source {% include open-new-window.html text='Prometheus monitoring and alerting toolkit' url='https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/' %}. With these tools, you can view time-series metrics from {{site.prodname}} components in the Prometheus and Grafana interfaces, or scrape the metrics for a BYO Prometheus deployment.


### Install options

- Use Prometheus operator managed by Tigera operator

   You install the {{site.prodname}} Prometheus operator and CRDs during {{site.prodname}} installation. {{site.prodname}} metrics and alerts are available in Manager UI. You configure alerts through Prometheus AlertManager.
   
   If you want to specify your own Prometheus operator during installation for management by the Tigera operator, the require operator version must be **v0.40.0 or higher**. Because {{site.prodname}} creates AlertManager and Prometheus CRs in the `tigera-prometheus` namespace, all you need to do is verify that your Prometheus operator is configured to manage Prometheus and AlertManager instances in the `tigera-prometheus` namespace.
