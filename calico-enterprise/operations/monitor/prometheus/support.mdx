# Prometheus support

## Big picture

{{prodname}} uses the open-source [Prometheus monitoring and alerting toolkit](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/). With these tools, you can view time-series metrics from {{prodname}} components in the Prometheus and Grafana interfaces, or scrape the metrics for a BYO Prometheus deployment.

## Install options

### Use Prometheus operator managed by Tigera operator

You install the {{prodname}} Prometheus operator and CRDs during {{prodname}} installation. {{prodname}} metrics and alerts are available in Manager UI. You configure alerts through Prometheus AlertManager.

If you want to specify your own Prometheus operator during installation for management by the Tigera operator, the required operator version must be **v0.40.0 or higher**. Because {{prodname}} creates AlertManager and Prometheus CRs in the `tigera-prometheus` namespace, all you need to do is verify that your Prometheus operator is configured to manage Prometheus and AlertManager instances in the `tigera-prometheus` namespace.

#### Prometheus on {{prodnameWindows}}

By default, the Windows firewall blocks listening on ports. For {{prodname}} to manage the Prometheus metrics ports Windows firewall rules, enable the `windowsManageFirewallRules` setting in FelixConfiguration:

```bash
kubectl patch felixConfiguration default --type merge --patch '{"spec": {"windowsManageFirewallRules": "Enabled"}}'
```

[See the FelixConfiguration reference for more details](../../../reference/resources/felixconfig.mdx). You can also add a Windows firewall rule that allows listening on the Prometheus ports instead of having {{prodname}} manage it.

### Bring your own Prometheus

For details, see [Bring your own Prometheus](byo-prometheus.mdx).
