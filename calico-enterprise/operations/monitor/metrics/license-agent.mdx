# License metrics

import License from '@site/calico-enterprise/_includes/content/_license.mdx';

## Big picture

Use the Prometheus monitoring and alerting tool to get $[prodname] license metrics.

## Value

Platform engineering teams need to report licensing usage on third-party software (like $[prodname]) for their CaaS/Kubernetes platforms. This is often driven by compliance, but also to mitigate risks from license expiration or usage that may impact operations. For teams to easily access these vital metrics, $[prodname] provides license metrics using the Prometheus monitoring and alerting tool.

## Concepts

### About Prometheus

The Prometheus monitoring tool scrapes metrics from instrumented jobs and displays time series data in a visualizer (such as Grafana). For $[prodname], the “jobs” that Prometheus can harvest metrics from the License Agent component.

### About License Agent

The **License Agent** is a containerized application that monitors the following $[prodname] licensing information from the Kubernetes cluster, and exports the metrics through the Prometheus server:

- Days till expiration

## How to

- [Add license agent in your Kubernetes cluster](#add-license-agent-in-your-kubernetes-cluster)
- [Create alerts using Prometheus metrics](#create-alerts-using-prometheus-metrics)

### Add license agent in your Kubernetes cluster

To add the license-agent component in a Kubernetes cluster for license metrics, install the pull secret and apply the license-agent manifest.

1. Create a namespace for the license-agent.
   ```
    kubectl create namespace tigera-license-agent
   ```
1. Install your pull secret.
   ```
    kubectl create secret generic tigera-pull-secret \
      --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson -n tigera-license-agent \
      --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/pull/secret>
   ```
1. Apply the manifest.
   ```
    kubectl apply -f $[filesUrl]/manifests/licenseagent.yaml
   ```

### Create alerts using Prometheus metrics

In the following example, an alert is configured when the license expiry is fewer than 15 days.

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: calico-prometheus-license
  namespace: tigera-prometheus
  labels:
    role: tigera-prometheus-rules
    prometheus: calico-node-prometheus
spec:
  groups:
    - name: tigera-license.rules
      rules:
        - alert: CriticalLicenseExpiry
          expr: license_number_of_days < 15
          labels:
            severity: Warning
          annotations:
            summary: 'Calico Enterprise License expires in less than 15 days'
            description: 'Calico Enterprise License expires in less than 15 days'
```

:::note

If the Kubernetes api-server serves on any port other than 6443 or 443, add that port in the Egress policy of the license agent manifest.
