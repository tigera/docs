### Big picture

`calicoctl` allows you to create, read, update, and delete {{site.prodname}} objects
from the command line. These objects represent the networking and policy
of your cluster.

You should limit access to `calicoctl` and your {{site.prodname}} datastore to
trusted administrators. We discuss methods of limiting access to the
{{site.prodname}} datastore in the [configuration section](configure).

You can run `calicoctl` on any host with network access to the
{{site.prodname}} datastore as either a binary or a container.
As a binary on a single host, you can also run it as a kubectl plugin.

### How to

> **Note**: Make sure you always install the version of `calicoctl` that matches the version of {{site.prodname}} running on your cluster.

#### Install calicoctl as a container on a single host

1. Ensure that you have the [`config.json` file with the private Tigera registry credentials]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/calico-enterprise#get-private-registry-credentials-and-license-key).

1. From a terminal prompt, use the following command to either create or open the `~/.docker/config.json` file.

   ```bash
   vi ~/.docker/config.json
   ```

1. Depending on the existing contents of the file, edit it in one of the following ways.

   - **New file**: Paste in the entire contents of the `config.json` file from Tigera.

   - **Existing file without quay.io object**: Add the following lines from the `config.json` inside the `"auth"` object.

     ```json
     "quay.io": {
       "auth": "<ROBOT-TOKEN-VALUE>",
       "email": ""
     }
     ```

   - **Existing file with quay.io object**: Add the following lines from the `config.json` inside the `"quay.io"` object.

     ```json
     "auth": "<ROBOT-TOKEN-VALUE>",
     "email": ""
     ```

1. Save and close the file.

1. Use the following commands to pull the `{{include.cli}}` image from the Tigera
   registry.

   ```bash
   docker pull {{page.registry}}{% include component_image component=include.cli %}
   ```

1. Confirm that the image has loaded by typing `docker images`.
{%- assign c = site.data.versions.first.components[include.cli] %}

   ```bash
   REPOSITORY                TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
   {{ c.image }}    {{ c.version }}            e07d59b0eb8a   2 minutes ago   42MB
   ```
   {: .no-select-button}

**Next step**:

[Configure calicoctl to connect to your datastore]({{site.baseurl}}/maintenance/clis/calicoctl/configure).

#### Install calicoctl as a Kubernetes pod

Run the following to deploy the `calicoctl` container to your nodes.

```bash
kubectl apply -f {{ "/manifests/calicoctl.yaml" | absolute_url }}
```
> **Note**: You can also {% include open-new-window.html text='view the YAML in a new tab' url='/manifests/calicoctl.yaml' %}.
{: .alert .alert-info}

You can then run commands using kubectl as shown below.

```bash
kubectl exec -ti -n kube-system calicoctl -- /calicoctl get profiles -o wide
```

An example response follows.

```
NAME                 TAGS
kns.default          kns.default
kns.kube-system      kns.kube-system
```
{: .no-select-button}

We recommend setting an alias as follows.

```bash
alias calicoctl="kubectl exec -i -n kube-system calicoctl -- /calicoctl"
```

> **Note**: In order to use the `calicoctl` alias when reading manifests, redirect the file into stdin, for example: ```bash calicoctl create -f - < my_manifest.yaml.```
