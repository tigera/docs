# Provide TLS certificates for log storage

## Big picture

Provide TLS certificates to secure access to {{prodname}} to the log storage.

## Value

Providing TLS certificates for {{prodname}} components is recommended as part of a zero trust network model for security.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following features:

- **LogStorage** resource

## Before you begin...

By default, the {{prodname}} log storage uses self-signed certificates on connections. To provide TLS certificates,
get the certificate and key pair for the {{prodname}} log storage using any X.509-compatible tool or from your organization's
Certificate Authority. The certificate must include the following Subject Alternate Names or DNS names `tigera-secure-es-http.tigera-elasticsearch.svc` and `tigera-secure-es-gateway-http.tigera-elasticsearch.svc`.

If your cluster has Windows nodes, the certificate must additionally include `tigera-secure-es-http.tigera-elasticsearch.svc.<cluster_domain>` where `<cluster_domain>` is the local domain specified for in-cluster DNS.

## How to

### Add TLS certificates for log storage

To provide TLS certificates for use by {{prodname}} components during deployment, you must create a secret before applying the 'custom-resource.yaml' or before creating the LogStorage resource. Use the following command to create a secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic tigera-secure-elasticsearch-cert -n tigera-operator --from-file=tls.crt=</path/to/certificate-file> --from-file=tls.key=</path/to/key-file>
```

To update existing certificates, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic tigera-secure-elasticsearch-cert -n tigera-operator --from-file=tls.crt=</path/to/certificate-file> --from-file=tls.key=</path/to/key-file> --dry-run -o yaml --save-config | kubectl replace -f -
```

:::note

If the {{prodname}} log storage already exists, you must manually delete the log storage pods one by one
after updating the secret. These pods will be in the `tigera-elasticsearch` namespace with the prefix, `tigera-secure-es`.
Other {{prodname}} components will not be unable to communicate with log storage until the pods are restarted.
