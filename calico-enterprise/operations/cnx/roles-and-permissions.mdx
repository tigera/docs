### Big picture

Configure roles using Kubernetes RBAC and lock down user permissions to {{site.prodname}} features and functions.

### Value

Self-service is an important part of your Kubernetes platform networking and network security. When you allow developers to define policies with guardrails, you create more self-service in the CI/CD process. But network security architects require assurances that developers can access only the resources they are entitled to. 

### Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{site.prodname}} features:

- **Calico Enterprise API server**

### Concepts

#### Kubernetes RBAC authorization

The [Calico Enterprise API server]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.APIServer) is an extension to the standard {% include open-new-window.html text='Kubernetes RBAC Authorization APIs' url='https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/' %}. You configure fine-grained user permissions using `Role`, `ClusterRole`, `RoleBinding`and `ClusterRoleBinding` with the standard RBAC controls: get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete. 

| Features                       | RBAC controls for...                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Network policy                 | - Tiered policy, including AWS security groups and federated services.<br />- Kubernetes network policy (in default tier)<br />- {{site.prodname}} network policies including namespaces<br />- Staged policy, policy recommendation, policy preview |
| Compliance                     | Report management, generation, export, and status.           |
| Visibility and troubleshooting | Elasticsearch logs: flow, audit, dns, intrusion detection, bgp |
| Multi-cluster management       | Management and managed clusters in single management plane.  |


#### Predefined roles and permissions

{{site.prodname}} provides the following predefined roles and permissions:

`tigera-ui-user`
- Basic user with access to {{site.prodname}} Manager UI and Kibana:
  - List/view Calico Enterprise policy and tier resources in the `projectcalico.org` and `networking.k8s.io` API groups
  - List/view logs in Kibana

`tigera-network-admin`
- Superuser access for Kibana (including Elastic user and license management), and all Calico resources in `projectcalico.org` and `networking.k8s.io` API groups (get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete) 

`mcm-user`
- Admin user with full permissions to management and managed clusters for multi-cluster management

### Above and beyond

For RBAC details on any given feature, see the feature. For example:

- [Tiered policy RBAC]({{site.baseurl}}/security/rbac-tiered-policies)
- [Policy preview RBAC]({{site.baseurl}}/security/policy-impact-preview)
- [Staged policy RBAC]({{site.baseurl}}/security/staged-network-policies) 
- [Elasticsearch logs RBAC]({{site.baseurl}}/visibility/elastic/rbac-elasticsearch) 
- [Compliance reports RBAC]({{site.baseurl}}/compliance/overview)
- [Multi-cluster management RBAC]({{site.baseurl}}/multicluster/mcm/create-a-management-cluster)
