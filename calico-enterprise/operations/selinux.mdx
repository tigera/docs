# SELinux

## Big picture

Run {{prodname}} on SELinux-enabled Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and binary-compatible operating systems.

## Value

Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) provides an additional layer of system security that defines how processes can interact with each other and various system resources.

## Concepts

In addition to the standard policy based access control, known as Discretionary Access Control (DAC), SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). It adds a context, or sometimes referred to as a label, to identify every process and system resource. SELinux contexts provide fine-grained access control that is enforced system-wide by the Linux kernel.

{{prodname}} implements a specialized policy package which uses SELinux contexts in a series of rules. It allows {{prodname}} components interact with persistent and ephemeral data in non-standard host system locations.

## Before you begin

**Required**

* SELinux-enabled RHEL or binary-compatible operating systems.

**Unsupported**

* None 100% bug-for-bug RHEL compatible operating systems like CentOS Stream.

## How To

To install {{prodname}} on SELinux-enabled operating systems, follow these steps.

1. Install {{prodname}} SELinux RPM package to all SELinux-enabled nodes. Only version 8 and 9 are supported.

```bash
. /etc/os-release
dnf install https://downloads.tigera.io/ee/archives/calico-selinux-1.0-1.el${VERSION_ID%.*}.noarch.rpm
