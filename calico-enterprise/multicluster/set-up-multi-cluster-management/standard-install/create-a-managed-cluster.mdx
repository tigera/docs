# Create a Calico Enterprise managed cluster

## Big picture

Create a {{prodname}} managed cluster that you can control from your management cluster.

## Value

Managing standalone clusters and multiple instances of Elasticsearch is not onerous when you first install {{prodname}}.
As you move to production with 300+ clusters, it is not scalable; you need centralized cluster management and log storage.
With {{prodname}} multi-cluster management, you can securely connect multiple clusters from different cloud providers
in a single management plane, and control user access using RBAC. This architecture also supports federation of network
policy resources across clusters, and lays the foundation for a “single pane of glass.”

## Before you begin...

**Required**

- A [Calico Enterprise management cluster](create-a-management-cluster.mdx)
- A [{{prodname}} license and pull secret](../../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/calico-enterprise.mdx)

## How to

### Create a managed cluster

Follow these steps in the cluster you intend to use as the managed cluster.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes" value="Kubernetes-0">

<InstallGeneric clusterType='managed' />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="GKE" value="GKE-1">

<InstallGKE clusterType='managed' />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="EKS" value="EKS-2">

<InstallEKS clusterType='managed' />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="AKS" value="AKS-3">

<InstallAKS clusterType='managed' />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Openshift" value="Openshift-4">

<InstallOpenShift clusterType='managed' />

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Next steps

- When you are ready to fine-tune your multi-cluster management deployment for production, see [Fine-tune multi-cluster management](../../fine-tune-deployment.mdx)
- To change an existing {{prodname}} standalone cluster to a management or managed cluster, see [Change cluster types](../../change-cluster-type.mdx)
