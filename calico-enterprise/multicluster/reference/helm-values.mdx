# Helm values

Reference for Helm `values.yaml` blocks used in $[prodname] multi-cluster management installations.

For the complete Helm installation reference, see [Helm installation reference](../../reference/installation/helm_customization).

## Management cluster values

### `managementCluster`

Configure the cluster as a management cluster.

```yaml
managementCluster:
  enabled: true
  address: <management-cluster-addr>:<port>
  service:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
    type: NodePort            # or LoadBalancer
    port: 9449
    targetPort: 9449
    protocol: TCP
    nodePort: 30449           # only for NodePort
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `enabled` | Set to `true` to configure this cluster as a management cluster. |
| `address` | The address (host:port) that managed clusters use to connect. For LoadBalancer, set this after the LB is provisioned. |
| `service.enabled` | Set to `true` to create a Service to expose the management cluster. |
| `service.type` | `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`. |
| `service.port` | Service port. Must be `9449`. |
| `service.targetPort` | Target port on the Manager pod. Must be `9449`. |
| `service.nodePort` | External node port (NodePort only). |
| `service.annotations` | Service annotations (e.g., for AWS NLB configuration). |

#### EKS LoadBalancer annotations

If using EKS with a LoadBalancer, add the following annotations:

```yaml
managementCluster:
  service:
    annotations:
    - key: service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type
      value: "external"
    - key: service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type
      value: "instance"
    - key: service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme
      value: "internet-facing"
```

### `managedClusters`

Register managed clusters on the management cluster.

```yaml
managedClusters:
  enabled: true
  clusters:
  - name: my-managed-cluster
    operatorNamespace: tigera-operator
    certificate: <base64-encoded-cert>
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `enabled` | Set to `true` to register managed clusters. |
| `clusters[].name` | Name of the managed cluster. |
| `clusters[].operatorNamespace` | Namespace where the Tigera Operator runs on the managed cluster. |
| `clusters[].certificate` | Base64-encoded certificate for the managed cluster. |

## Managed cluster values

### `managementClusterConnection`

Configure the cluster as a managed cluster.

```yaml
managementClusterConnection:
  enabled: true
  managementClusterAddress: <management-cluster-addr>:<port>
  management:
    tls:
      crt: <base64-management-cluster-cert>
  managed:
    tls:
      crt: <base64-managed-cluster-cert>
      key: <base64-managed-cluster-key>
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `enabled` | Set to `true` to configure this cluster as a managed cluster. |
| `managementClusterAddress` | Address of the management cluster. |
| `management.tls.crt` | Base64-encoded TLS certificate of the management cluster. |
| `managed.tls.crt` | Base64-encoded TLS certificate for the managed cluster. |
| `managed.tls.key` | Base64-encoded TLS private key for the managed cluster. |

:::note

When installing a managed cluster with Helm, also set `logStorage.enabled=false` and `manager.enabled=false` because these components run on the management cluster.
