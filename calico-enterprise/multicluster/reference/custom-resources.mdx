# Custom resources

This page provides a quick reference for the custom resource definitions (CRDs) used in $[prodname] multi-cluster management and cluster mesh.

## Multi-cluster management CRDs

| Resource | API Group | Cluster | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ManagementCluster](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#managementcluster) | `operator.tigera.io/v1` | Management | Declares a cluster as a management cluster. Specifies the address that managed clusters use to connect. |
| [ManagedCluster](../../reference/resources/managedcluster.mdx) | `projectcalico.org/v3` | Management | Registers a managed cluster on the management cluster. Creating this resource generates an installation manifest for the managed cluster. |
| [ManagementClusterConnection](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#managementclusterconnection) | `operator.tigera.io/v1` | Managed | Connects a managed cluster to the management cluster. Applied from the manifest generated by the ManagedCluster resource. |

## Cluster mesh CRDs

| Resource | API Group | Cluster | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [RemoteClusterConfiguration](../../reference/resources/remoteclusterconfiguration.mdx) | `projectcalico.org/v3` | Any | Configures a connection to a remote cluster in the mesh. References a Secret containing a kubeconfig for the remote cluster. Controls overlay routing mode. |

## Usage patterns

### Management cluster setup

1. Apply a `ManagementCluster` resource on the management cluster to declare it as a management cluster and specify the connection address.
2. For each managed cluster, create a `ManagedCluster` resource on the management cluster.
3. Apply the generated `ManagementClusterConnection` manifest on the managed cluster.

### Cluster mesh setup

1. For each cluster pair (A, B), create a `RemoteClusterConfiguration` in cluster A referencing cluster B's kubeconfig, and vice versa.
2. Set `syncOptions.overlayRoutingMode` to `Enabled` for $[prodname] multi-cluster networking, or `Disabled` for network-provided routing.
