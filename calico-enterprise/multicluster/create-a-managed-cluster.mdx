### Big picture

Create a {{site.prodname}} managed cluster that you can control from your management cluster.

### Value

Managing standalone clusters and multiple instances of Elasticsearch is not onerous when you first install {{site.prodname}}. 
As you move to production with 300+ clusters, it is not scalable; you need centralized cluster management and log storage. 
With {{site.prodname}} multi-cluster management, you can securely connect multiple clusters from different cloud providers 
in a single management plane, and control user access using RBAC. This architecture also supports federation of network 
policy resources across clusters, and lays the foundation for a “single pane of glass.” 

### Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{site.prodname}} features:

- **Installation API** with `ManagementClusterConnection` resource
- {{site.prodname}} Manager user interface

### Before you begin...

**Required**

- A [Calico Enterprise management cluster]({{site.baseurl}}/multicluster/mcm/create-a-management-cluster)
- A [{{site.prodname}} license and pull secret]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/calico-enterprise)

### How to

#### Create a managed cluster
Follow these steps in the cluster you intend to use as the managed cluster.

### Next steps

- When you are ready to fine-tune your multi-cluster management deployment for production, see [Fine-tune multi-cluster management]({{site.baseurl}}/multicluster/mcm/fine-tune-deployment)
- To change an existing {{site.prodname}} standalone cluster to a management or managed cluster, see [Change cluster types]({{site.baseurl}}/multicluster/mcm/change-cluster-type)
