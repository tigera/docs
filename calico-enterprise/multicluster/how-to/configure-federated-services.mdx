# Configure federated services

Configure local clusters to discover services across multiple clusters.

## Before you begin

**Required**

- [Set up cluster mesh](set-up-cluster-mesh.mdx) with federated endpoint identity configured

## How to

- [Create service resources](#create-service-resources)
- [Create a federated service](#create-a-federated-service)
- [Access a federated service](#access-a-federated-service)

### Create service resources

On each cluster in the mesh that is providing a particular service, create your service resources as you normal would with the following requirements:

- Services must all be in the same namespace.
- Configure each service with a common label key and value to identify the common set of services across your clusters (for example, `run=my-app`).

Kubernetes manages the service by populating the service endpoints from the pods that match the selector configured in the service spec.

### Create a federated service

1. On a cluster that needs to access the federated set of pods that are running an application, create a
   service on that cluster leaving the `spec selector` blank.
1. Set the `federation.tigera.io/serviceSelector` annotation to be a $[prodname] selector that selects the previously-configured services using the matching label match (for example, `run == "my-app"`).

The Federated Services Controller manages this service, populating the service endpoints from all of the services that match the service selector configured in the annotation.

### Access a federated service

Any application can access the federated service using the local DNS name for that service. The simplest way to access a federated service is through its corresponding DNS name.

By default, Kubernetes adds DNS entries to access a service locally. For a service called `my-svc` in the namespace
`my-namespace`, the following DNS entry would be added to access the service within the local cluster:

```
my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
```

DNS lookup for this name returns the fixed ClusterIP address assigned for the federated service. The ClusterIP is translated in iptables to one of the federated service endpoint IPs, and is load balanced across all of the endpoints.

## Example

### Create a service

In the following example, the remote cluster defines the following service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    run: my-app
  name: my-app
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    run: my-app
  ports:
    - name: my-app-ui
      port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 9000
    - name: my-app-console
      port: 81
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 9001
  type: ClusterIP
```

This service definition exposes two ports for the application `my-app`. One port for accessing a UI, and the other for accessing a management console. The service specifies a Kubernetes selector, which means the endpoints for this service are automatically populated by Kubernetes from matching pods within the services own cluster.

### Create a federated service

To create a federated service on your local cluster that federates the web access port for both the local and remote service, you would create a service resource on your local cluster as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-federated
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    federation.tigera.io/serviceSelector: run == "my-app"
spec:
  ports:
    - name: my-app-ui
      port: 8080
      protocol: TCP
  type: ClusterIP
```

The `spec.selector` is not specified so it will not be managed by Kubernetes. Instead, we use a `federation.tigera.io/serviceSelector` annotation, indicating that this is a federated service managed by the Federated Services Controller.

The controller matches the `my-app` services (matching the run label) on both the local and remote clusters, and consolidates endpoints from the `my-app-ui` TCP port for both of those services. Because the federated service does not specify the `my-app-console` port, the controller does not include these endpoints in the federated service.

The endpoints data for the federated service is similar to the following. Note that the name of the remote cluster is included in `targetRef.name`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2018-07-03T19:41:38Z
  annotations:
    federation.tigera.io/serviceSelector: run == "my-app"
  name: my-app-federated
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: '701812'
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/endpoints/my-app-federated
  uid: 1a0427e8-7ef9-11e8-a24c-0259d75c6290
subsets:
  - addresses:
      - ip: 192.168.93.12
        nodeName: node1.localcluster.tigera.io
        targetRef:
          kind: Pod
          name: my-app-59cf48cdc7-frf2t
          namespace: default
          resourceVersion: '701655'
          uid: 19f5e914-7ef9-11e8-a24c-0259d75c6290

        port: 80
        protocol: TCP

          resourceVersion: '701648'
          uid: 19e2c841-7ef9-11e8-a24c-0259d75c6290
    ports:
      - name: my-app-ui
        port: 80
        protocol: TCP
```
