# Configure log storage

Review and configure log storage for your multi-cluster management deployment.

## Review log storage collection and retention

Because the management cluster stores all log data across your managed clusters, choose a size to accommodate your anticipated data volume. See [Adjust log storage size](../../operations/logstorage/adjust-log-storage-size.mdx).

## Filter log data for a managed cluster in Kibana

1. Log in to the $[prodname] web console.
1. In the left navigation, click Kibana and log in to the Kibana dashboard.
1. Navigate to the Discovery view and filter logs by managed cluster indexes.
1. Select a type of log (audit, dns, events, flow).
1. From the Available Fields section in the side panel, select the `_index` field.

   ![Kibana Cluster Indexes](/img/calico-enterprise/mcm/mcm-kibana.png)

In the example above, the selected log type (flow logs) has the index prefix, `tigera_secure_ee_flows` and two cluster indexes available:

- Index: tigera_secure_ee_flows.cluster.20200207
- Index: tigera_secure_ee_flows.app-cluster-1.20200207

:::note

The management cluster has a default cluster name to identify indexes. When filtering logs for the management cluster, use the cluster name: `cluster`.

:::

To filter log data by a given managed cluster you can include the filter criteria `_index: <log type>.<cluster name>.*` to your query when executing a search through the Kibana UI.
