# TigeraStatus

Installing {{prodname}} on your Kubernetes cluster is managed by the Tigera operator. The operator gets its configuration from the API resources and communicates through the Kubernetes API. The operator is deployed as a Deployment in the `tigera-operator` namespace, and records status in the `tigerastatus` resource. Depending on how your cluster is configured, you can get `tigerastatus` on these resources:

- apiserver
- applicationlayer
- authentication
- calico
- calico-windows
- compliance
- egressgateway
- intrusion detection
- log-collector
- log-storage
- log-storage-access
- log-storage-elastic
- log-storage-kubecontrollers
- log-storage-secrets
- log-storage-users
- manager
- management-cluster-connection
- policy-recommendation
- secrets

## Get TigeraStatus

To get tigerastatus for a resource, run the following command:

   `kubectl get tigerastatus`

For detailed output (including messages and further details on any non-functioning components), run either of the following commands:

   `kubectl describe tigerastatus X`

   `kubectl get tigerastatus X -o yaml`

## Log storage

Log storage provides persistent storage for {{prodname}} Elasticsearch logs (flow, dns, l7, bpg, audit, etc.), and compliance reports.

To check log storage status, run the following command:

   `kubectl get tigerastatus log-storage`

The following table lists the type of information displayed in TigerStatus for log storage.
