title: Staged network policy
description: API for this Calico Enterprise resource. 
---

A staged network policy resource (`StagedNetworkPolicy`) represents an ordered set of rules which are applied
to a collection of endpoints that match a [label selector](#selector). These rules are used to preview network behavior and do
not to enforce network traffic. For enforcing network traffic, see [network policy resource]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/resources/networkpolicy).

`StagedNetworkPolicy` is a namespaced resource. `StagedNetworkPolicy` in a specific namespace
only applies to [workload endpoint resources]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/resources/workloadendpoint)
in that namespace. Two resources are in the same namespace if the `namespace`
value is set the same on both.
See [staged global network policy resource]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/resources/stagedglobalnetworkpolicy) for staged non-namespaced network policy.

`StagedNetworkPolicy` resources can be used to define network connectivity rules between groups of {{site.prodname}} endpoints and host endpoints, and
take precedence over [profile resources]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/resources/profile) if any are defined.

StagedNetworkPolicies are organized into [tiers]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/resources/tier), which provide an additional layer of orderingâ€”in particular, note that the `Pass` action skips to the
next [tier]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/resources/tier), to enable hierarchical security policy.

For `kubectl` [commands](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/){:target="_blank"}, the following case-insensitive aliases
may be used to specify the resource type on the CLI:
`stagednetworkpolicy.projectcalico.org`, `stagednetworkpolicies.projectcalico.org` and abbreviations such as
`stagednetworkpolicy.p` and `stagednetworkpolicies.p`.

### Sample YAML

This sample policy allows TCP traffic from `frontend` endpoints to port 6379 on
`database` endpoints.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: StagedNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: internal-access.allow-tcp-6379
  namespace: production
spec:
  tier: internal-access
  selector: role == 'database'
  types:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - action: Allow
    protocol: TCP
    source:
      selector: role == 'frontend'
    destination:
      ports:
      - 6379
  egress:
  - action: Allow
```

### Definition

#### Metadata

| Field     | Description                                                        | Accepted Values                                     | Schema | Default   |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|
| name      | The name of the network policy. Required.                          | Alphanumeric string with optional `.`, `_`, or `-`. | string |           |
| namespace | Namespace provides an additional qualification to a resource name. |                                                     | string | "default" |


#### Spec

| Field    | Description                                                                                         | Accepted Values | Schema                | Default |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------|
| order    | Controls the order of precedence. {{site.prodname}} applies the policy with the lowest value first. |                 | float                 |         |
| tier     | Name of the [tier]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/resources/tier) this policy belongs to.                                                   |                 | string                 |  `default` |
| selector | Selects the endpoints to which this policy applies.                                                 |                 | [selector](#selector) | all()   |
| types    | Applies the policy based on the direction of the traffic. To apply the policy to inbound traffic, set to `Ingress`. To apply the policy to outbound traffic, set to `Egress`. To apply the policy to both, set to `Ingress, Egress`. | `Ingress`, `Egress` | List of strings | Depends on presence of ingress/egress rules\* |
| ingress  | Ordered list of ingress rules applied by policy.                                                    |                 | List of [Rule](#rule) |         |
| egress   | Ordered list of egress rules applied by this policy.                                                |                 | List of [Rule](#rule) |         |
 serviceAccountSelector | Selects the service account(s) to which this policy applies.                           |                 | [selector](#selector)  | all()   |

\* If `types` has no value, {{site.prodname}} defaults as follows.

>| Ingress Rules Present | Egress Rules Present | `Types` value       |
 |-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
 | No                    | No                   | `Ingress`           |

### Application layer policy

Application layer policy is an optional feature of {{site.prodname}} and
[must be enabled]({{site.baseurl}}/security/app-layer-policy)
in order to use the following match criteria.

> **NOTE**: Application layer policy match criteria are supported with the following restrictions.
>  * Only ingress policy is supported. Egress policy must not contain any application layer policy match clauses.
>  * Rules must have the action `Allow` if they contain application layer policy match clauses.
