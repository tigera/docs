**What happens when a license expires or is invalid?**  
   Users can log in to Manager UI with read/access for all previously-created resources, but they cannot create any new {{site.prodname}} resources. The Manager UI may appear to function, but actions will not be applied; so it is important to proactively managed your license. 

**What happens if I add nodes beyond what I'm licensed for?**

- Node limits are not currently enforced
- All {{site.prodname}} features still work

**How do I get information about my license? Monitor the expiration date?**  
   - [Prometheus!]({{site.baseurl}}/maintenance/monitor/metrics/license-agent). Monitor days till expiration, nodes available, and nodes used.
   - Use `kubectl` to get [license key information]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/resources/licensekey#viewing-information-about-your-license-key)
