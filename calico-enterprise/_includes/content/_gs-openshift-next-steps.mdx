### Policy query with calicoq

Once {{site.prodname}} is installed in OpenShift, each node is automatically configured with
a `calicoctl.cfg` (owned by the root user) which is used by {{site.prodname}} to locate and authenticate requests to etcd.

We recommend installing `calicoq` as a container in OpenShift. Refer to [Installing calicoq as a container on a single host]({{site.baseurl}}/maintenance/clis/calicoq/#install-calicoq-as-a-container-on-a-single-host) for instructions.

> **Note**: Ensure that your configuration takes into account TLS-enabled etcd in OpenShift.
