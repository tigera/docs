Update the contents of the secret with the image pull secret provided to you by Tigera support representative.

For example, if the secret is located at `~/.docker/config.json`, run the following commands.

```bash
SECRET=$(cat ~/.docker/config.json | tr -d '\n\r\t ' | base64 -w 0)
sed -i "s/SECRET/${SECRET}/" manifests/02-pull-secret.yaml
```
