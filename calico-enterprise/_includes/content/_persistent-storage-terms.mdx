#### Persistent volume

Used by pods to persist storage within the cluster. Combined with **persistent volume claims**, pods can persist data across restarts and rescheduling.

#### Persistent volume claim

Used by pods to request and mount storage volumes. The claim specifies the volume requirements for the request: size, access rights, and storage class.

#### Dynamic provisioner

Provisions types of persistent volumes on demand. Although most managed public-cloud clusters provide a dynamic provisioner using cloud-specific storage APIs (for example, Amazon EBS or Google persistent disks), not all clusters have a dynamic provisioner.

When a pod makes a persistent volume claim from a storage class that uses a dynamic provisioner, the volume is automatically created. If the storage class does not use a dynamic provisioner (for example the local storage class), the volumes must be created in advance. For help, see the {% include open-new-window.html text='Kubernetes documentation' url='https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/' %}.

#### Storage class

The storage provided by the cluster. Storage classes can be used with dynamic provisioners to automatically provision persistent volumes on demand, or with manually-provisioned persistent volumes. Different storage classes provide different service levels.
