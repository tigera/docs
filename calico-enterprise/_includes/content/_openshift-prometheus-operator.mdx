Apply the {{site.prodname}} manifests for the Prometheus operator.
```bash
oc apply -f {{ "/manifests/ocp/tigera-prometheus-operator.yaml" | absolute_url }}
```

> **Note**: If you have a different Prometheus operator separate from {{site.prodname}} in your cluster that you want to use, skip this section. To work with {{site.prodname}}, your Prometheus operator must be v0.40.0 or higher.
