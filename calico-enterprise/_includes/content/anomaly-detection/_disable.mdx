By default, all detectors are enabled. You may want to temporarily disable a detector if it is creating too many alerts and you need to research the problem. Because detectors are CPU intensive, you may also want to disable specific detectors that you do not care about.

To disable an anomaly detector:

 - **AD_DISABLED_JOBS** 

      Default: "". 

To disable several detectors simultaneously, separate detector names with a comma `,`. For example: 

`l7_bytes,l7_latency`
