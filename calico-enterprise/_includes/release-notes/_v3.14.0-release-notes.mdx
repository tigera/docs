### Known issues (NEEDS TO BE UPDATED)

- Upgrading {{site.prodname}} to v3.13.0 using helm charts is not supported at this time.
- Installing {{site.prodname}} v3.13.0 on Mirantis MKE using helm charts is not supported at this time.
- Upgrading {{site.prodname}} v3.13.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{site.prodname}} v3.11.0, v3.11.1, v3.11.2, and v3.12.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
- Mirantis MKE is currently not supported due to upgrade issues on that platform. Please contact our support team for updates on this known issue.
- Multi-cluster Management: Starting with v3.6 the Intrusion Detection Job Installer was removed from Managed clusters. If you are running a Managed cluster v3.5 or older connected to a Management cluster v3.6 or newer, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade your Managed cluster to at least v3.6. See [Upgrade Instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/maintenance/upgrading-enterprise).
