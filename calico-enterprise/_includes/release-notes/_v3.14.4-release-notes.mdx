Tigera Operator version has been updated to v1.27.17. Please see [release notes](https://github.com/tigera/operator/releases/tag/v1.27.17) for details.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug causing liveness checks to fail for Calico Node during upgrades, due to changed field names in TLS secrets.
- Fixed a bug that prevented [controlPlaneNodeSelector]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.InstallationSpec) to be propagated to Prometheus and Alertmanager.

#### Enhancements
- Added [update strategy]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.InstallationSpec) to `typhaDeployment` for improved rollout experience during upgrades.
- Golang and base image updates to remove CVEs.
- The image for FlexVolume has changed from `docker.io/calico/pod2daemon-flexvol` to `quay.io/tigera/pod2daemon-flexvol`.

### Known issues
- Enabling L7 related Anomaly Detection jobs require L7 to be enabled on the cluster. AD job crashloops if L7 is not enabled.
- Upgrading {{site.prodname}} from v3.12.0 and earlier to v3.14.3 using helm charts is not supported at this time.
- Upgrading {{site.prodname}} v3.14.3 on Rancher/RKE from {{site.prodname}} v3.11.0, v3.11.1, v3.11.2, v3.12.0 and v3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
- Mirantis MKE has provisional support due to upgrade issues on that platform. Please contact our support team for upgrades or deployments on Mirantis MKE.
