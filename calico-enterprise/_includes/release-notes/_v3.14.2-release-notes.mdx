Tigera Operator version has been updated to v1.27.13. Please see [release notes](https://github.com/tigera/operator/releases/tag/v1.27.13) for details.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where the es-proxy container would not trust the certificate of the Dex service when an identity provider has been configured. This would result in failure to show the service graph and failure to log into Kibana using the button in the UI.
- Fixed a bug causing the Service Graph to show incorrect policy evaluations.
- Fixed a bug where deleting packet capture files would result in an error.
- Fixed a bug where the health probe for Prometheus would not pick up HTTP proxy environment settings.
- Lowered the log level for incoming requests in the Elasticsearch Gateway image from `Info` down to `Debug`.

### Enhancements

- {{prodname}} can now be installed on RKE2 clusters with a CIS Profile enabled.
- The [Compliance resource](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.Compliance) is no longer a requirement for other components and can be removed by users who have no need for compliance reports.
- Added [remote cluster status metrics](../../reference/component-resources/kube-controllers/prometheus.mdx) to the `calico-kube-controllers` deployment that lets users monitor the connectivity status for federated clusters.

## Known issues

- Enabling L7 related Anomaly Detection jobs require L7 to be enabled on the cluster. AD job crashloops if L7 is not enabled.
- Upgrading {{prodname}} from v3.12.0 and earlier to v3.14.1 using helm charts is not supported at this time.
- Upgrading {{prodname}} v3.14.1 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} v3.11.0, v3.11.1, v3.11.2, v3.12.0 and v3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
- Mirantis MKE has provisional support due to upgrade issues on that platform. Please contact our support team for upgrades or deployments on Mirantis MKE.
- BPF dataplane in combination with IPIP encapsulation on kernels 5.14 (4.18.0-330 in RHEL based distros) and newer can fail to attach the correct BPF program, causing node traffic to fail. A fix for this issue will be made available in v3.14.3.
