Tigera Operator version has been updated to v1.27.15. Please see [release notes](https://github.com/tigera/operator/releases/tag/v1.27.15) for details.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where multiple RoleBindings for a user caused unexpected errors in the Service Graph UI.
- Fixed a bug where the BPF dataplane in combination with IPIP encapsulation on kernels 5.14 (4.18.0-330 in RHEL based distros) failed to attach the correct BPF program, causing node traffic to fail.
- Fixed a bug that prevented Anomaly Detection jobs on Openshift from running.
- Fixed a bug where Egress Gateways failed to sync policy after calico-node restarts.

### Enhancements

- Golang and base image updates to remove CVEs.

## Known issues

- Enabling L7 related Anomaly Detection jobs require L7 to be enabled on the cluster. AD job crashloops if L7 is not enabled.
- Upgrading {{prodname}} from v3.12.0 and earlier to v3.14.3 using helm charts is not supported at this time.
- Upgrading {{prodname}} v3.14.3 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} v3.11.0, v3.11.1, v3.11.2, v3.12.0 and v3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
- Mirantis MKE has provisional support due to upgrade issues on that platform. Please contact our support team for upgrades or deployments on Mirantis MKE.
