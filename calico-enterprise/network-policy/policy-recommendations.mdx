# Enable policy recommendations

## Big picture

Use policy recommendations to automatically isolate namespaces with network policy.

## Value

One of the best practices for improving the security posture of your Kubernetes cluster is to implement namespace isolation with network policy. Namespace isolation helps to implement a zero-trust and least-privileged security model, where only required communication between namespaces are authorized and everything else is blocked. This helps mitigate the risk of lateral movement within a cluster in the event of an attack.

{{prodname}} makes it easy for platform operators to implement namespace isolation without experience in authoring network policy or detailed knowledge of how application workloads are communicating. {{prodname}} analyzes the flow logs that are generated from workloads, and automatically recommends and stages policies for each namespace that can be used for isolation.

## Before you begin

**Required**

To enable/disable policy recommendations, you must have the **tigera-admin** role, or permissions to the **Policy Recommendations** resource. 

**Recommended**

Basic knowledge of policies and tiers:
- [Get started with tiered network policy](../network-policy/policy-tiers/tiered-policy)
- [Network policy tutorial](../network-policy/policy-tiers/policy-tutorial-ui)

**Limitations**

Creating and managing policy recommendations is available only in Manager UI. `kubectl` commands are available to update Policy Recommendations resource parameters.

## How to

- [Enable policy recommendations](#enable-policy-recommendations)
- [Activate and review policy recommendations](#activate-and-review-policy-recommendations) 
- [Review runtime settings for workloads](#review-runtime-settings-for-workloads) 
- [Update policy recommendations](#manage-policy-recommendations)
- [Troubleshoot policy recommendations](#troubleshoot-policy-recommendations)
- [Disable the policy recommendations feature](#disable-the-policy-recommendations-feature)

### Enable policy recommendations

1. In the left navbar in Manager UI, click **Policies**, **Recommendations**.
1. On the opt-in page, click **Enable Policy Recommendations**.

   ![Enable policy recommendations](/img/calico-enterprise/enable-policy-recommendations.png)

The **Policy Recommendations** board is automatically displayed. 

![Policy recommendations board](/img/calico-enterprise/policy-recommendations-board.png)

**Notes**:
- A policy recommendation is generated for every namespace in your cluster (unless namespaces are filtered out by an Admin using the PolicyRecommendationScope resource)
- Traffic originating from the policy recommendations namespace is used to generate egress rules, and traffic destined for the namespace is used to define ingress rules
- Flow log patterns and processes are continuously monitored for policy recommendations. As the cluster changes and new namespaces are created, you can get a new policy recommendation. 
- Policy recommendations are created as **staged network policies** so you can safely observe the traffic before enforcing them
- To stop policy recommendations from being processed or updated for a namespace, click the **Action** menu, **Dismiss policy**. 

### Activate and review policy recommendations

Policy recommendations are not active until you move them to the **Policies Board**. 

From the Policy Recommendation board, select a policy recommendation (or bulk select) and select, **Add to policy board**.  

In the left navbar, click **Policies**, **Default**.

![Policies board](/img/calico-enterprise/policy-recommendations-tier.png)

Policy recommendations are added to the **namespace-isolation** tier. Note the following:

- Staged network policy recommendations work like any other staged network policies; they are differentiated from regular staged policies by the `recommendation` suffix
- You can move policy recommendation staged policies to other tiers
- The `namespace-isolation` tier name is fixed and cannot be changed
- An on-demand version of policy recommendations is available on **Policies board**, **Edit**, **Recommend a policy**.

You are now ready to observe traffic flows in Policies board to verify that the policy is authorizing traffic as expected. When a policy works as expected, you can safely enforce it. See [Stage, preview impacts, and enforce policy](staged-network-policies.mdx) for help. 

### Update policy recommendations

This section describes common changes you may want to make to policy recommendations.

#### Rerun policy recommendation for an existing staged policy

As new namespace and components are added to a cluster, your policy recommendation won’t allow traffic to them. If a policy recommendation has not been enforced, you’ll need to update it to allow traffic.

1. On the **Policies Recommendations** board, click the **Active tab**, which lists the active staged network policies. 
1. Select the Actions menu associated with the policy in question, and click **Dismiss policy**. 
1. Click the **Dismissed tab**, select the Actions meun, and Reactivate the policy.

#### Rerun policy recommendations for an enforced policy

Delete or rename the policy so a new staged network policy is recreated on the Policy Recommendations board.

#### Stop policy recommendations updates for a namespace

1. On the Policies Recommendations board, click the **Active** tab, which lists the active staged network policies.
1. Select the namespace, click the **Actions** menu, and click **Dismiss policy**.

### Review runtime settings for workloads 

The default runtime settings for capturing flows for policy recommendations, are based on application workloads with *frequent communication with other namespaces in your cluster*. 

Global settings for namespaces are found on the Policy Recommendations board, **Action** menu. 

![Global settings dialog](/img/calico-enterprise/global-settings.png)

:::tip
For application workloads with less frequent communication, the sampling for flow logs may not be long enough, so you’ll want to increase one or both settings. We recommend that you review your workloads immediately after you enable policy recommendations and adjust the settings accordingly. 
:::

To update runtime settings for an existing staged policy recommendation, delete or rename the policy so a new staged network policy is recreated on the Policy Recommendations board.

Changes to all other policy recommendations parameters require Admin permissions and can be changed using the [Policy recommendations resource](../reference/resources/stagednetworkpolicy).

### Troubleshoot policy recommendations

To view error logs in Kibana, go to **Logs**, and access the `tigera-policy-recommendation` namespace.

**Problem**: I’m not seeing policy recommendations on the Policy Recommendations board.
**Solution/workaround**: Policy recommendations are based on historical flow logs that match a request, and are generated only for flows that are denying traffic. As such, there are times when policy recommendations will not be generated:

- Not enough traffic history 

   If you recently installed {{prodname}}, you may not have enough traffic history. Workloads must run for some time (ballpark is 5 days) to get “typical network traffic” for applications.

- Denied traffic flows are covered by existing policy

   Even if your cluster has been running for a long time with traffic flows, the flows may already be covered by existing policies. 

To verify that you have traffic flows, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Service Graph**, **Default**.
1. Filter flow logs for your namespace.
1. In the Actions menu, you should see **Denied** flows.

If you do not have denied traffic, but still want to test policy recommendations, you can create sample pods, namespaces, and denied traffic. For help, see [Create denied traffic flows to get policy recommendations](../network-policy/denied-traffic-flows). 

### Disable the policy recommendations feature

To disable the policy recommendations feature, set the **RecStatus** parameter to `Disabled` in the [Policy recommendations resource](../reference/resources/stagednetworkpolicy) resource.

Note that unactivated policy recommendations in the Policies Recommendations board are no longer updated. Existing activated and enforced staged network and policies are not affected by disabling policy recommendations.
