# Enforce application layer policies on your apps (tutorial)

This tutorial shows how to use {{prodname}} application layer policy to restrict ingress traffic for applications and microservices.
Assume that the application is installed in your {{prodname}} cluster and that the following application pods are running. 

```
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
customer-2809159614-qqfnx   3/3       Running   0          21h
database-1601951801-m4w70   3/3       Running   0          21h
summary-2817688950-g1b3n    3/3       Running   0          21h
```

Here, we have three microservices - customer, database, and summary. Only pods that need access to a service should get it.
The customer web service does not need, and should not have direct access to the backend database. The customer web service needs to 
directly interact with clients outside the cluster, some of whom may be malicious. 

Imagine what would happen if an attacker were to gain control of the customer web pod in our
application. Let's simulate this by executing a remote shell inside that pod.

    kubectl exec -ti customer-<fill in pod ID> -c customer -- bash

Notice that from here, we get direct access to the backend database. For example, we can list all the entries in the database like this:

    curl http://database:2379/v2/keys?recursive=true | python -m json.tool

(Piping to `python -m json.tool` nicely formats the output.)


## Apply application layer policy

With a {{prodname}} policy, you can mitigate risks to the banking application.

    wget {{filesUrl}}/security/tutorials/app-layer-policy/manifests/30-policy.yaml
    kubectl create -f 30-policy.yaml


Let's examine this policy piece by piece. It consists of three policy objects, one for each
microservice.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: customer
spec:
  selector: app == 'customer'
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      http:
        methods: ['GET']
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

The first policy protects the customer web app. Because this application is customer-facing, we do not
restrict what can communicate with it. We do, however, restrict its communications to HTTP `GET`
requests.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: summary
spec:
  selector: app == 'summary'
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      source:
        serviceAccounts:
          names: ['customer']
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

The second policy protects the account summary microservice. We know the only consumer of this
service is the customer web app, so we restrict the source of incoming connections to the service
account for the customer web app.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: database
spec:
  selector: app == 'database'
    ingress:
      - action: Allow
        source:
          serviceAccounts:
            names: ["summary"]
    egress:
      - action: Allow
```

The third policy protects the database. Only the summary microservice should have direct access to
the database.

### Verify the policy is working

Let's verify our policy is working as intended. First, return to your browser and refresh to
ensure policy enforcement has not broken the application.

Next, return to the customer web app. Recall that we simulated an attacker gaining control of that
pod by executing a remote shell inside it.

    `kubectl exec -ti customer-<fill in pod ID> -c customer bash`

Repeat our attempt to access the database.

    curl -I http://database:2379/v2/keys?recursive=true

We have left out the JSON formatting because we do not expect to get a valid JSON response. This
time we should get a `403 Forbidden` response. Only the account summary microservice has database
access according to our policy.
