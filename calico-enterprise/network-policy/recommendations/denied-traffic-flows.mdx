# Create denied traffic flows to get policy recommendations

## Big picture

To use the [policy recommendation feature](policy-recommendations.mdx), you must have traffic between pods in namespaces that are denying traffic. However, you may already have policies in place to allow traffic. If you want to play with policy recommendations, follow these steps to create namespaces and pods with denied traffic. 

### Create namespaces 

In this example, we create two namespaces: ns1 and ns2.

```batch
$ kubectl create namespace ns1
$ kubectl create namespace ns2
```

### Create pods in namespaces 

Now we create `pod1` in ns1 and `pod2` in ns2 namespaces. 

```batch
$ kubectl apply -f my-pods.yaml
```

**my-pods.yaml**

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod1
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod2
  namespace: ns2
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

### Create traffic flows between pods

Get the IP address for `pod2`.

```
$ kubectl get pod pod2 -nns2 -o template --template={{.status.podIP}}
> 192.168.160.142
```

Next, curl `pod2` pod from `pod1` using the IP from the previous command, and port 80 (the listening port of the `pod2`).

```batch
kubectl exec -it pod1 -n ns1 -- curl http://192.168.160.142:80
```

You should get a 404 error. This is the expected response because flows are not allowed. 

### Next step

You are now ready to [enable policy recommendations](policy-recommendations#enable-policy-recommendations) and see flows that can be allowed.
