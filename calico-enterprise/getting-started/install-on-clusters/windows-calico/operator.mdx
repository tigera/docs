# Install using Operator

## Big picture

Install {{prodnameWindows}} on your Kubernetes cluster using the Tigera Operator.

## Concepts

{{prodnameWindows}} is a hybrid implementation that requires a Linux cluster for {{prodname}} components and Linux workloads, and Windows nodes for Windows workloads.

## Before you begin

Review the [Linux requirements](../requirements.mdx) and the [{{prodnameWindows}} requirements](requirements.mdx).

Before beginning, setup a {{prodname}} cluster on Linux nodes and provision Windows machines.

## How to

- [Configure strict affinity for clusters using {{prodname}} networking](#configure-strict-affinity-for-clusters-using-calico-networking)
- [Install {{prodnameWindows}} using the operator](#install-{{prodnamedashWindows}}-using-the-operator)

### Configure strict affinity for clusters using {{prodname}} networking

For Linux control nodes using {{prodname}} networking, strict affinity must be set to `true`.
This is required to prevent Linux nodes from borrowing IP addresses from Windows nodes:

```bash
kubectl patch ipamconfigurations default --type merge --patch='{"spec": {"strictAffinity": true}}'
```

### Install {{prodnameWindows}} using the operator

With Kubernetes v1.22, there is a new Windows container type called **HostProcess containers (HPC)** that can run directly on the host with access to the host network namespace,
storage, and devices. With this feature, {{prodnameWindows}} can now be installed and managed using Kubernetes resources such as Daemonsets and ConfigMaps,
instead of needing to configure and install {{prodnameWindows}} manually on each node. Using this installation method, the {{prodnameWindows}}
services are no longer registered on the host. Instead, the services are run directly within HostProcess containers.

#### HPC requirements

In addition to the [{{prodnameWindows}} requirements](requirements.mdx),
this installation method has [additional requirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/create-hostprocess-pod/):

- Kubernetes v1.22+
- Enable HostProcess containers support. For Kubernetes v1.22, see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/create-hostprocess-pod/#before-you-begin). For Kubernetes v1.23+, HostProcess containers are enabled by default.
- [containerd](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#containerd) v1.6+
- The Windows nodes have joined the cluster.

To install containerd on the Windows node and configure the containerd service:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest {{windowsScriptsURL}}/Install-Containerd.ps1 -OutFile c:\Install-Containerd.ps1
c:\Install-Containerd.ps1 -ContainerDVersion 1.6.22 -netAdapterName Ethernet -skipHypervisorSupportCheck -CNIConfigPath "c:/etc/cni/net.d" -CNIBinPath "c:/opt/cni/bin"
```

If you have an existing {{prodnameWindows}} installation using the manual method, your Windows nodes may have already joined the cluster.

To join a Windows node to a cluster provisioned with kubeadm:

- Install kubeadm and kubelet binaries and install the kubelet service

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest {{windowsScriptsURL}}/PrepareNode.ps1 -OutFile c:\PrepareNode.ps1
c:\PrepareNode.ps1 -KubernetesVersion v1.26.6
```

- Run kubeadm on a control plane host and copy the join command

```bash
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

- Edit the join command by updating the kubeadm.exe path to `c:\k\kubeadm.exe`.
- If using a Kubernetes version earlier than v1.25, also append `--cri-socket "npipe:////./pipe/containerd-containerd"` to the join command.
  An example join command:

```
c:\k\kubeadm.exe join 172.16.101.139:6443 --token v8w2jt.jmc45acn85dbll1e --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:d0b7040a704d8deb805ba1f29f56bbc7cea8af6aafa78137a9338a62831739b4 --cri-socket "npipe:////./pipe/containerd-containerd"
```

- Run the join command on the Windows node. Shortly after it completes successfully, the Windows node will appear in `kubectl get nodes`.
  The new node's status will be NotReady since the Calico CNI has not yet been installed.

#### Migrate from {{prodnameWindows}} manual installation to operator installation

The HPC installation in this guide is operator-based and will automatically migrate your Windows nodes that have {{prodnameWindows}} installed using the manual installation method. This installation process will uninstall any existing {{prodnameWindows}} services and overwrite the {{prodnameWindows}} installation files with those included in the `tigera/cni-windows` and `tigera/cnx-node-windows` images. If `kubelet` was installed using `{{rootDirWindows}}\kubernetes\install-kube-services.ps1`, this service will remain installed. If the `kube-proxy` service was also installed using `{{rootDirWindows}}\kubernetes\install-kube-services.ps1`, it will be stopped and uninstalled by the `calico-node-windows` HPC initContainers. It is recommended to run `kube-proxy-windows` as hostprocess container images using the [manifest provided in the kubernetes-sigs sig-windows-tools repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-windows-tools/master/hostprocess/calico/kube-proxy/kube-proxy.yml).

:::note

Before proceeding, take note of the configuration parameters in `{{rootDirWindows}}\config.ps1`. These configuration parameters will be needed during the install.

#### Operator installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes VXLAN" value="Kubernetes VXLAN-4">

<CalicoWindowsInstall networkingType='vxlan' />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes BGP" value="Kubernetes BGP-5">

<CalicoWindowsInstall networkingType='windows-bgp' />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Congratulations! You now have a Kubernetes cluster with {{prodnameWindows}} and a Linux control node.

## Next steps

You can now use the {{prodname}} Linux-based docs site for your documentation. Before you continue, review the [Limitations and known issues](limitations.mdx) to understand the features (and sections of documentation) that do not apply to Windows.
