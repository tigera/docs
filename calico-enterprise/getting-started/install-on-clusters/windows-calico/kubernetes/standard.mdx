# Install Calico Enterprise for Windows

## Big picture

Install {{prodnameWindows}} on Kubernetes clusters. The standard installation for {{prodnameWindows}} requires more time and expertise to configure. If you need to get started quickly, we recommend the [Quickstart](../quickstart.mdx)

## Value

Extend your Kubernetes deployment to Windows environments.

## Before you begin

**Required**

- Linux and Windows nodes [meet requirements](requirements.mdx)
- You will need the {{prodnameWindows}} zip archive provided to you by your support representative.
- If using {{prodname}} networking:
  - Copy the kubeconfig file (used by kubelet) to each Windows node to the file, `c:\k\config`.
  - Install and configure [calicoctl](../../../../operations/clis/calicoctl/install.mdx)
- Download {{prodnameWindows}} and Kubernetes binaries to each Windows nodes to prepare for install:

- On each of your Windows nodes, prepare the Windows node for {{prodnameWindows}} installation:

  - Enable TLS v1.2:

  ```powershell
  [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
  ```

  - Copy the {{prodnameWindows}} zip archive to `c:\tigera-calico-windows.zip`
  - Download the {{prodnameWindows}} installation script:

  ```powershell
  Invoke-WebRequest {{tmpScriptsURL}}/scripts/install-calico-windows.ps1 -OutFile c:\install-calico-windows.ps1
  ```

  - Run the {{prodnameWindows}} installation script:

  ```powershell
  c:\install-calico-windows.ps1 -DownloadOnly yes -KubeVersion <your Kubernetes version>
  ```

  For example, `c:\install-calico-windows.ps1 -DownloadOnly yes -KubeVersion 1.17.9`

  After these steps, run `ls c:\TigeraCalico` and you will see the calico-node.exe binary, install scripts, and other files.

## How to

Because the Kubernetes and {{prodname}} control components do not run on Windows yet, a hybrid Linux/Windows cluster is required. First you create a Linux cluster for {{prodname}} components, then you join Windows nodes to the Linux cluster.

1. [Install {{prodnameWindows}} and Kubernetes on Windows nodes](#install-calico-enterprise-for-windows-and-kubernetes-on-windows-nodes)

### Create a Linux cluster

There are many ways to create a Linux Kubernetes cluster. We regularly test {{prodnameWindows}} with `kubeadm`.

### Ensure pods run on the correct nodes

A primary issue of running a hybrid Kubernetes cluster is that many Kubernetes manifests do not specify a **node selector** to restrict where their pods can run. For example, `kubeadm` installs `kube-proxy` (Kubernetes per-host NAT daemon) using a DaemonSet that does not include a node selector. This means that the kube-proxy pod, which only supports Linux, will be scheduled to both Linux and Windows nodes. Services/pods that should run only on Linux nodes (such as the `kube-proxy` DaemonSet) should be started with a node selector to avoid attempting to schedule them to Windows nodes.

To get around this for `kube-proxy`:

1. Use `kubectl` to retrieve the DaemonSet.

   ```bash
   kubectl get ds kube-proxy -n kube-system -o yaml > kube-proxy.yaml
   ```

1. Modify the `kube-proxy.yaml` file to include a node selector that selects only Linux nodes:

   ```yaml noValidation
   spec:
     template:
     ...
       spec:
         nodeSelector:
           kubernetes.io/os: linux
         containers:
   ```

1. Apply the updated manifest.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kube-proxy.yaml
   ```

A similar change may be needed for other Kubernetes services (such as `kube-dns` or `core-dns`).

### Prepare Windows nodes to join the Linux cluster

On each Windows node, follow the steps below to configure `kubelet` and `kube-proxy` service.

**Step 1: Configure kubelet**

`kubelet` must be configured to use CNI networking by setting the following command line arguments, depending on the installed container runtime.

For Docker:

- `--network-plugin=cni`
- `--cni-bin-dir=<directory for CNI binaries>`
- `--cni-conf-dir=<directory for CNI configuration>`

For containerd:

- `--container-runtime=remote`
- `--container-runtime-endpoint=npipe:////.//pipe//containerd-containerd`

The CNI bin and conf dir settings are required by the {{prodname}} installer to install the CNI binaries and configuration file.

:::note

Among other parameters, the containerd configuration file includes options to configure the CNI bin and conf dirs.

:::

The following kubelet settings are also important:

- `--hostname-override` can be set to $(hostname) to match {{prodname}}'s default. `kubelet` and {{prodname}} must agree on the host/nodename; if your network environment results in hostnames that vary over time you should set the hostname override to a static value per host and update {{prodname}}'s nodename accordingly.
- `--node-ip` should be used to explicitly set the IP that kubelet reports to the API server for the node. We recommend setting this to the host's main network adapter's IP since we've seen kubelet incorrectly use an IP assigned to a HNS bridge device rather than the host's network adapter.
- Because of a Windows networking limitation, if using {{prodname}} IPAM, --max-pods should be set to, at most, the IPAM block size of the IP pool in use minus 4:

  | **IP pool block size** | **Max pods**   |
  | ---------------------- | -------------- |
  | /n                     | 2^/32-n^ - 4   |
  | /24                    | 252            |
  | /25                    | 124            |
  | /26 (default)          | 60             |
  | /27                    | 28             |
  | /28                    | 12             |
  | /29                    | 4              |
  | /30 or above           | Cannot be used |

In addition, it's important that `kubelet` is started after the vSwitch has been created, which happens when {{prodname}} initializes the dataplane. Otherwise, `kubelet` can be disconnected for the API server when the vSwitch is created.

**AWS users**: Add the following argument to `kubelet`:

`--hostname-override=<aws instance private DNS name>` (and set the {{prodname}} nodename variable to match). In addition, you should add `KubernetesCluster=<cluster-name>` as a tag when creating your Windows instance.

**As a quickstart**, the {{prodname}} package includes a sample script at `{{rootDirWindows}}\kubernetes\kubelet-service.ps1` that:

- Waits for {{prodname}} to initialise the vSwitch
- Starts `kubelet` with
  - If containerd service is running, the following flags are set:
    - --container-runtime set to `remote`
    - --container-runtime-endpoint set to `npipe:////.//pipe//containerd-containerd`
  - Otherwise, the following flags are set for Docker:
    - --network-plugin set to `cni`
    - --cni-bin-dir set to `c:\k\cni`
    - --cni-conf-dir set to `c:\k\cni\config`
    - --pod-infra-container-image set to `kubeletwin/pause`
  - --kubeconfig set to the path of node kubeconfig file
  - --hostname-override set to match {{prodname}}'s nodename
  - --node-ip set to the IP of the default vEthernet device
  - --cluster-dns set to the IPs of the dns name servers

See the README in the same directory for more details. Feel free to modify the script to adjust other `kubelet` parameters.

:::note

The script will pause at the first stage until {{prodname}} is installed by following the instructions in the next section.

:::

**Step 2: Configure kube-proxy**

`kube-proxy` must be configured as follows:

- With the correct HNS network name used by the active CNI plugin. kube-proxy reads the HNS network name from an environment variable KUBE_NETWORK
  - With default configuration, {{prodname}} uses network name "{{prodname}}"
- For VXLAN, with the source VIP for the pod subnet allocated to the node. This is the IP that kube-proxy uses when it does SNAT for a NodePort. For {{prodname}}, the source VIP should be the second IP address in the subnet chosen for the host. For example, if {{prodname}} chooses an IP block 10.0.0.0/26 then the source VIP should be 10.0.0.2. The script below will automatically wait for the block to be chosen and configure kube-proxy accordingly.
- For {{prodname}} policy to function correctly with Kubernetes services, the WinDSR feature gate must be enabled. This requires Windows Server build 17763.1432 or greater and Kubernetes v1.14 or greater. {{prodname}} will automatically enable the WinDSR feature gate if kubernetes services are managed by {{prodnameWindows}}.

`kube-proxy` should be started via a script that waits for the Calico HNS network to be provisioned. The {{prodname}} package contains a suitable script for use with {{prodname}} networking at `{{rootDirWindows}}\kubernetes\kube-proxy-service.ps1`. The script:

- Waits for {{prodname}} to initialise the vSwitch.
- Calculates the correct source VIP for the local subnet.
- Starts kube-proxy with the correct feature gates and hostname to work with {{prodname}}.

See the README in the same directory for more details. Feel free to modify the script to
adjust other kube-proxy parameters.

The script will pause at the first stage until {{prodname}} is installed by following the instructions in the next section.

### Install {{prodname}} on Linux control and worker nodes

**If using {{prodname}} BGP networking**

1. [Install Calico Enterprise for networking and policy](../../kubernetes/index.mdx) for Kubernetes datastore (kdd).
1. Disable the default {{prodname}} IP-in-IP networking (which is not compatible with Windows), by modifying the {{prodname}} manifest, and setting the `CALICO_IPV4POOL_IPIP` environment variable to "Never" before applying the manifest.

   If you do apply the manifest with the incorrect value, changing the manifest and re-applying will have no effect. To adjust the already-created IP pool:

   ```bash
   kubectl get ippool -o yaml > ippool.yaml
   ```

   Then, modify ippool.yaml by setting the `ipipMode` to `Never` and then apply the updated manifest:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ippool.yaml
   ```

**If using {{prodname}} VXLAN networking**

1. Modify VXLAN as described in [Overlay Networking](../../../../networking/configuring/vxlan-ipip.mdx) guide. Note the following:

   - Windows can support only a single type of IP pool so it is important that you use only a single VXLAN IP pool in this mode.
   - Windows supports only VXLAN on port 4789 and VSID >=4096. {{prodname}}'s default (on Linux and Windows) is to use port 4789 and VSID 4096.

1. Apply the manifest using `kubectl`, and verify that you have a single pool with `VXLANMODE Always`.

   ```bash
   kubectl get ippool -o wide
   ```

1. Disable BGP routing by updating the Installation instance:
   ```bash
   kubectl patch installation default --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"calicoNetwork": {"bgp": "Disabled"}}}'
   ```

For Linux control nodes using {{prodname}} networking, strict affinity must be set to `true`.
This is required to prevent Linux nodes from borrowing IP addresses from Windows nodes:

```bash
calicoctl ipam configure --strictaffinity=true
```

### Install {{prodnameWindows}} and Kubernetes on Windows nodes

Follow the steps below on each Windows node to install Kubernetes and {{prodname}}:

**If using {{prodname}} BGP**

Install the RemoteAccess service using the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature RemoteAccess
Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-RemoteAccess-PowerShell
Install-WindowsFeature Routing
```

Then restart the computer:

```powershell
Restart-Computer -Force
```

before running:

```powershell
Install-RemoteAccess -VpnType RoutingOnly
```

Sometimes the remote access service fails to start automatically after install. To make sure it is running, execute the following command:

```powershell
Start-Service RemoteAccess
```

1. If using a non-{{prodname}} network plugin for networking, install and verify it now.
2. Edit the install configuration file, `config.ps1` as follows:

   | **Set this variable...**       | To...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The default uses the node's hostname. **Note**: If you are using the sample kubelet start-up script from the {{prodname}} package, kubelet is started with a hostname override that forces it to use this value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
   |                                | For AWS to work properly, kubelet should use the node's internal domain name for the AWS integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
   |                                | If using {{prodname}} BGP networking, the install script will generate a CNI NetConf file from the file cni.conf.template. Certain advanced configuration can be accessed by modifying the template before install. **Note**: Prior to Kubernetes v1.13, Kubernetes lacked support for setting the correct DNS configuration on each pod. To work around that limitation, the CNI configuration includes DNS settings that are applied to pods whenever the kubelet fails to pass DNS configuration to the CNI plugin. For v1.13 and above, the DNS configuration of the template is ignored in favour of correct per-pod values learned from the kubelet. |

3. Run the installer.

   - Change directory to the location that you unpacked the archive. For example:

     ```powershell
     PS C:\... > cd c:\TigeraCalico
     ```

   - Run the install script:

     ```powershell
     PS C:\... > .\install-calico.ps1
     ```

   :::note

   The installer initializes the Windows vSwitch, which can cause a short connectivity outage as the networking stack is reconfigured. After running that command, you may need to:

   - Reconnect to your remote desktop session.
   - Restart `kubelet` and `kube-proxy` if they were already running.
   - If you haven't started `kubelet` and `kube-proxy` already, you should do so now. The quickstart scripts provided in the {{prodname}} package provide an easy way to do this. {{prodnameWindows}} requires `kubelet` to be running to complete its per-node configuration (since Kubelet creates the Kubernetes Node resource).

   :::

   :::note

   After you run the installer, do not move the directory because the service registration refers to the path of the directory.

   :::

4. Verify that the {{prodname}} services are running.

   ```powershell
   Get-Service -Name CalicoNode
   Get-Service -Name CalicoFelix
   ```
