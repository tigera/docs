## Big picture

Install $[prodname] on a Red Hat Openshift on AWS (ROSA) cluster. Classic ROSA does not support installations with custom CNI plugin. ROSA with HCP clusters allows installing $[prodname]. 

## Value

Provides steps to install $[prodname] in [Red Hat Openshift on AWS (ROSA)](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/introduction_to_rosa/index) with HCP clusters.

## Before you begin

- Ensure that your environment meets the $[prodname] [system requirements](requirements.mdx).

- Ensure that you have a [RedHat account](https://cloud.redhat.com/). A RedHat account is required to get the pull secret necessary to provision a ROSA cluster. 

- Ensure that you have:

    - Configured an AWS account appropriate for OpenShift 4
    - [Set up your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)
    - Enabled ROSA with HCP and HCP classic on AWS.
    - Ensured you have met the resource quota requirements for ROSA on AWS.
    - Linked AWS and Red Hat accounts.
    - Generated a local SSH private key and added it to your ssh-agent

- Install the ROSA CLI and fulfill all the other [prerequisites from the ROSA documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html-single/prepare_your_environment/index)

- Create a [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for your ROSA cluster](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/install_clusters/rosa-hcp-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly#rosa-hcp-creating-vpc) following the documentation.

## How to

### Create roles, policies

- Create the account wide STS roles and policies needed to create a ROSA with HCP cluster by following the [Red Hat documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/install_rosa_with_hcp_clusters/rosa-hcp-cluster-no-cli#rosa-hcp-sts-creating-a-cluster-cli_rosa-hcp-cluster-no-cni-no-cni).

- Create the [OpenID Connect (OIDC) configuration](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/install_rosa_with_hcp_clusters/rosa-hcp-cluster-no-cli#rosa-sts-byo-oidc_rosa-hcp-cluster-no-cni) prior to creating the ROSA with HCP cluster.

- Create [Operator IAM roles and policies](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/install_rosa_with_hcp_clusters/rosa-hcp-cluster-no-cli#rosa-operator-config_rosa-hcp-cluster-no-cni) needed for ROSA with HCP clusters.

### Create ROSA cluster with HCP and no CNI plugin

Follow the steps from the Red Hat Openshift on AWS documentation to [create a ROSA cluster with HCP and no CNI plugin](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/install_rosa_with_hcp_clusters/rosa-hcp-cluster-no-cli#rosa-hcp-sts-creating-a-cluster-cli_rosa-hcp-cluster-no-cni-no-cni).

### Create a storage class

$[prodname] requires storage for logs and reports. Before finishing the installation, you must [create a StorageClass for $[prodname]](../../../operations/logstorage/create-storage).

### Download the $[prodname] install manifests

:::note

For OpenShift **v4.16 or newer** on **AWS**, configure AWS security groups to allow BGP, typha and IP-in-IP encapsulation traffic.

```
    Custom TCP traffic
    Port: 179
    Description: BGP (Calico)
    
    Custom TCP traffic
    Port: 5473
    Description: Typha (Calico)
    
    Custom protocol
    Protocol: 4
    Description: IP-in-IP (Calico)
```

:::

Now download and apply the $[prodname] manifests.

<DownloadOpenShiftManifests />

### Add an image pull secret

Update the contents of the secret with the image pull secret provided to you by a Tigera support representative.

For example, if the secret is located at ~/.docker/config.json, run the following commands.

```
SECRET=$(cat ~/.docker/config.json | tr -d '\n\r\t ' | base64 -w 0)
sed -i "s/SECRET/${SECRET}/" calico/02-pull-secret.yaml
```

### Optionally provide additional configuration

You may want to provide $[prodname] with additional configuration at install-time. For example, BGP configuration or peers.
You can use a Kubernetes ConfigMap with your desired Calico resources to set configuration as part of the installation.
If you do not need to provide additional configuration, you can skip this section.

To include [Calico resources](../../../reference/resources/index.mdx) during installation, edit `calico/02-configmap-calico-resources.yaml` to add your own configuration.

:::note
If you have a directory with the Calico resources, you can create the file with the command:

```
oc create configmap -n tigera-operator calico-resources \
--from-file=<resource-directory> --dry-run -o yaml \
calico/02-configmap-calico-resources.yaml
```

With recent versions of oc it is necessary to have a kubeconfig configured or add `--server='127.0.0.1:443'`
even though it is not used.
:::

:::note
If you have provided a `calico-resources` configmap and the tigera-operator pod fails to come up with `Init:CrashLoopBackOff`,
check the output of the init-container with `oc logs -n tigera-operator -l k8s-app=tigera-operator -c create-initial-resources`.
:::

### Apply the $[prodname] install manifests

Apply the install manifests paying attention to the required order. First apply all necessary manifests to install the Tigera Operator:

```
cd calico/
ls 00* | xargs -n1 oc apply -f
ls 01* | xargs -n1 oc apply -f
ls 02* | xargs -n1 oc apply -f
```

Then wait until the Tigera Operator creates the necessary CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) before applying the CustomResources to install $[prodname] on your cluster:

```
timeout --foreground 600 bash -c "while ! kubectl get crd installations.operator.tigera.io; do sleep 5; done" # wait until CRDs are created by the operator
ls 03* | xargs -n1 oc apply -f
```

:::note
You can safely ignore any `ls: cannot access '0X*': No such file or directory` errors if there's no yaml files with that prefix to be applied.
:::

### Install the $[prodname] license

In order to use $[prodname], you must install the license provided to you by Tigera support representative. Before applying the license, wait until the Tigera API server is ready with the following command:

```
watch oc get tigerastatus
```

Wait until the `apiserver` shows a status of `Available`.

After the Tigera API server is ready, apply the license:

```
oc create -f </path/to/license.yaml>
```

### Install $[prodname] resources

## Next steps

**Recommended**

- [Configure access to the $[prodname] web console](../../../operations/cnx/access-the-manager.mdx)
- [Authentication quickstart](../../../operations/cnx/authentication-quickstart.mdx)
- [Configure your own identity provider](../../../operations/cnx/configure-identity-provider.mdx)

**Recommended - Networking**

- The default networking uses IP in IP encapsulation with BGP routing. For all networking options, see [Determine best networking option](../../../networking/determine-best-networking.mdx).

**Recommended - Security**

- [Get started with $[prodname] tiered network policy](../../../network-policy/policy-tiers/tiered-policy.mdx)
