### Big picture

Move Calico Enterprise container images to an image path in a private registry and configure {{ site.prodname }} to pull images from it.

### Value

Install Calico Enterprise in clusters where pulling from third party private repos is not an option, and all images are desired to be part of a single directory in the private registry.

### Concepts

A **container image registry** (often referred to as a **registry**) is a service where container images are pushed to, stored, and pulled from. A registry is said to be "private" if it requires users authenticate before accessing images.

An **image path** is a directory in the private registry that contains images required to install {{ site.prodname }}.

An **image pull secret** is used in Kubernetes to deploy container images from a private container image registry.

### Before you begin...
