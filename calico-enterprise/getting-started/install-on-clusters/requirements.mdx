# System requirements

import DockerEe from '@site/calico-enterprise/_includes/content/_docker-ee.mdx';

<ReqsSys orch='Kubernetes' />

## Kubernetes requirements

### Supported Kubernetes versions

We test {{prodname}} {{version}} against the following Kubernetes versions.

- v1.21
- v1.22
- v1.23

Other versions may work, but we do not actively test {{prodname}}
{{version}} against them.

### Supported managed Kubernetes versions

We test {{prodname}} {{version}} against the following managed Kubernetes versions.

- AKS: 1.21, 1.22
- GKE: 1.21
- EKS: 1.21

Other versions may work, but we do not actively test {{prodname}}
{{version}} against them.

### Supported Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE) versions

We test {{prodname}} {{version}} against the following MKE versions.

<DockerEe />

Other versions may work, but we do not actively test {{prodname}}
{{version}} against them.

### CNI plug-in enabled

{{prodname}} is installed as a CNI plugin. The kubelet must be configured
to use CNI networking by passing the `--network-plugin=cni` argument. (On
kubeadm, this is the default.)

### Other network providers

{{prodname}} must be the only network provider in each cluster. We do
not currently support migrating a cluster with another network provider to
use {{prodname}} networking.

### Supported kube-proxy modes

{{prodname}} supports the following kube-proxy modes:

- `iptables` (default)

### IP pool configuration

The IP range selected for pod IP addresses cannot overlap with any other
IP ranges in your network, including:

- The Kubernetes service cluster IP range
- The range from which host IPs are allocated
