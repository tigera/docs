### Kubernetes requirements

#### Supported Kubernetes versions

We test {{site.prodname}} {{page.version}} against the following Kubernetes versions.

- v1.21
- v1.22
- v1.23

Other versions may work, but we do not actively test {{site.prodname}}
{{page.version}} against them.

#### Supported managed Kubernetes versions

We test {{site.prodname}} {{page.version}} against the following managed Kubernetes versions.

- AKS: 1.22 
- GKE: 1.21
- EKS: 1.21

Other versions may work, but we do not actively test {{site.prodname}}
{{page.version}} against them.

#### Supported Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE) versions

We test {{site.prodname}} {{page.version}} against the following MKE versions.

{% include content/docker-ee.md %}

Other versions may work, but we do not actively test {{site.prodname}}
{{page.version}} against them.

#### CNI plug-in enabled

{{site.prodname}} is installed as a CNI plugin. The kubelet must be configured
to use CNI networking by passing the `--network-plugin=cni` argument. (On
kubeadm, this is the default.)

#### Other network providers

{{site.prodname}} must be the only network provider in each cluster. We do
not currently support migrating a cluster with another network provider to
use {{site.prodname}} networking.

#### Supported kube-proxy modes

{{site.prodname}} supports the following kube-proxy modes:
- `iptables` (default)

#### IP pool configuration

The IP range selected for pod IP addresses cannot overlap with any other
IP ranges in your network, including:

- The Kubernetes service cluster IP range
- The range from which host IPs are allocated

### Application layer policy requirements

- {% include open-new-window.html text='MutatingAdmissionWebhook' url='https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook' %} enabled
- Istio {% include open-new-window.html text='v1.9' url='https://archive.istio.io/v1.9/' %} or {% include open-new-window.html text='v1.10' url='https://archive.istio.io/v1.10/' %}

Note that Kubernetes version 1.16+ requires Istio version 1.2 or greater.
Note that Istio version 1.9 requires Kubernetes version 1.17+.

As of Kubernetes v1.23, FlexVolumes have been deprecated in favor of the Container Storage Interface (CSI). Since our current application layer policy integration depends on FlexVolumes, it will not work on Kubernetes v1.23+.
