### Kubernetes requirements

#### Supported Kubernetes versions

We test {{site.prodname}} {{page.version}} against the following Kubernetes versions.

- v1.22
- v1.23
- v1.24

Other versions may work, but we do not actively test {{site.prodname}}
{{page.version}} against them.

#### Supported managed Kubernetes versions

We test {{site.prodname}} {{page.version}} against the following managed Kubernetes versions.

- {% include /content/aks.md %}
- {% include /content/gke.md %}
- {% include /content/eks.md %}

Other versions may work, but we do not actively test {{site.prodname}}
{{page.version}} against them.

#### Supported Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE) versions

We test {{site.prodname}} {{page.version}} against the following MKE versions.

{% include content/docker-ee.md %}

Other versions may work, but we do not actively test {{site.prodname}}
{{page.version}} against them.

#### CNI plug-in enabled

{{site.prodname}} is installed as a CNI plugin. The kubelet must be configured
to use CNI networking by passing the `--network-plugin=cni` argument. (On
kubeadm, this is the default.)

#### Other network providers

{{site.prodname}} must be the only network provider in each cluster. We do
not currently support migrating a cluster with another network provider to
use {{site.prodname}} networking.

#### Supported kube-proxy modes

{{site.prodname}} supports the following kube-proxy modes:
- `iptables` (default)

#### IP pool configuration

The IP range selected for pod IP addresses cannot overlap with any other
IP ranges in your network, including:

- The Kubernetes service cluster IP range
- The range from which host IPs are allocated
