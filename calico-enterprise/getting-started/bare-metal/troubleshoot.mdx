# Troubleshoot non-cluster hosts and VMs setup

This document provides guidance for troubleshooting non-cluster host setup for hosts and VMs.

## Useful commands

These commands can help you collect logs and monitor system activities during troubleshooting.

### On non-cluster hosts or VMs

```bash
journalctl -xue calico-node.service -f
journalctl -xue calico-fluent-bit.service -f
```

### On the cluster side

```bash
kubectl logs -n calico-system -l k8s-app=calico-typha-noncluster-host
kubectl logs -n tigera-manager -l k8s-app=tigera-manager -c tigera-voltron
```

Monitor CertificateSigningRequests (CSR):

```bash
kubectl get certificatesigningrequest -w
```

## Common problems

### No internet connection after installing the Calico Node package

By default, $[prodname] blocks all traffic to and from host interfaces. You can use a profile with host endpoints to modify default behavior. Apply the built-in profile `projectcalico-default-allow`, which allows all ingress and egress traffic. Host endpoints that use this profile will have *allow-all* behavior instead of *deny-all* when no network policy is applied.

### Certificate signed by unknown authority

If the certificate presented by the Kubernetes API server or Tigera Manager endpoint is not signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), add the correct CA certificate to the system trust store. For the Calico fluent-bit log forwarding, you can temporarily disable TLS verification by setting:

```conf
[OUTPUT]
    ...
    tls.verify  Off
    ...
```

in the configuration file `/etc/calico/calico-fluent-bit/calico-fluent-bit.conf`.

:::note

Disabling TLS verification should only be used for testing or troubleshooting.

### No object can be associated with CSR error

If a CSR is denied with the following error:

```text
invalid: no object can be associated with CSR node-certs-noncluster-host:<hostname>
```

verify the following:

* A corresponding host endpoint resource exists for the non-cluster host or VM.
* The `spec.node` field in the host endpoint resource matches the non-cluster host name exactly.

### Peer certificate does not have required CN

If the non-cluster host fails to connect to the dedicated Typha deployment, check that the certificate Common Name (CN) values are consistent on both sides.

On the non-cluster host or VM under the `/etc/calico/calico-node` folder:

* In `calico-node.conf`, verify the `TyphaCN` value matches the remote Typha server certificate CN, or
* In `calico-node.env`, verify the `FELIX_TYPHACN` value matches the remote Typha server certificate CN.

On the cluster side (`calico-system/calico-typha-noncluster-host` deployment):

* The `TYPHA_CLIENTCN` environment variable must match the CN used in the non-cluster node certificate.

### Certificate is not renewed or updated

The `calico-noncluster-host-init` process runs before the main `calico-node` service is responsible for renewing certificates that are expired or near expiry. Certificates are renewed automatically within 90 days of expiry.

If you need to force immediate renewal, manually delete the existing certificate (`calico-node.crt`) and private key (`calico-node.key`) under the `/etc/calico/calico-node` folder and restart the service.
