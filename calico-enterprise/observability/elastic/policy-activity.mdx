# Policy Activity Logs

:::note

This feature is tech preview. Tech preview features may be subject to significant changes before they become GA.

:::

## Big picture

Policy Activity Logs provide granular visibility into network policy behavior within your cluster.

## Value

Track exactly which rules are evaluated and triggered, offering policy-centric context that complements standard Flow Logs.

## How it works

- **Collection**: The Calico Enterprise automatically monitors policy and rule evaluations across your cluster.
- **Storage**: These events are securely forwarded and indexed in your Elasticsearch cluster for analysis.
- **Analysis**: You can query the logs to audit network policy and rules and validate policy enforcement history.

## Accessing the data

You can access Policy Activity Logs by querying Elasticsearch directly or visualizing them in Kibana (if configured).

### Log structure

Each log entry contains the following key fields:

| Field             | Description                                                                                  | Example                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `policy.kind`     | The type of the policy (e.g., `NetworkPolicy`, `GlobalNetworkPolicy`).                       | `NetworkPolicy`                  |
| `policy.namespace`| The namespace where the policy is defined.                                                   | `my-test`                        |
| `policy.name`     | The unique name of the policy.                                                               | `my-tier.my-networkpolicy`       |
| `rule`            | The identifier for the specific rule that was triggered, formatted as `{generation}-{direction}-{rule_index}`. | `2-ingress-4`  |
| `cluster`         | The name of the cluster where the activity occurred.                                         | `cluster`                        |
| `last_evaluated`  | The timestamp when the rule was last evaluated.                                              | `2025-12-01T23:09:28.384714204Z` |

### Sample query in Elasticsearch

To find policies unused for 90 days:

```
GET tigera_secure_ee_policy_activity*/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "last_evaluated": {
        "lte": "now-90d"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
