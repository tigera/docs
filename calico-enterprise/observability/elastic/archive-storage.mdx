# Archive logs

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Big picture

Archive $[prodname] logs to SIEMs like Syslog, Splunk, or Amazon S3 to meet compliance storage requirements.

## Value

Archiving your $[prodname] Elasticsearch logs to storage services like Amazon S3, Syslog, or Splunk are reliable
options for maintaining and consolidating your compliance data long term.

## Before you begin

**Supported logs for export**

- Syslog - flow, dns, idsevents, audit
- Splunk - flow, audit, dns
- Amazon S3 - l7, flow, dns, audit

## How to

:::note
Because $[prodname] and Kubernetes logs are integral to $[prodname] diagnostics, there is no mechanism to tune down the verbosity. To manage log verbosity, filter logs using your SIEM.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Amazon S3" value="Amazon S3-0">

1. Create an AWS bucket to store your logs.
   You will need the bucket name, region, key, secret key, and the path in the following steps.

2. Create a Secret in the `tigera-operator` namespace named `log-collector-s3-credentials` with the fields `key-id` and `key-secret`.
   Example:

   ```
    kubectl create secret generic log-collector-s3-credentials \
    --from-literal=key-id=<AWS-access-key-id> \
    --from-literal=key-secret=<AWS-secret-key> \
    -n tigera-operator
   ```

3. Update the [LogCollector](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.LogCollector)
   resource named, `tigera-secure` to include an [S3 section](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.S3StoreSpec)
   with your information noted from above.
   Example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: LogCollector
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   spec:
     additionalStores:
       s3:
         bucketName: <S3-bucket-name>
         bucketPath: <path-in-S3-bucket>
         region: <S3-bucket region>
   ```

   This can be done during installation by editing the custom-resources.yaml
   by applying it, or after installation by editing the resource with the command:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit logcollector tigera-secure
   ```

<TabItem label="Syslog" value="Syslog-1">

1. Update the [LogCollector](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.LogCollector)
   resource named `tigera-secure` to include a [Syslog section](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.SyslogStoreSpec)
   with your syslog information.
   Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: LogCollector
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   spec:
     additionalStores:
       syslog:
         # (Required) Syslog endpoint, in the format protocol://host:port
         endpoint: tcp://1.2.3.4:514
         # (Optional) If messages are being truncated set this field
         packetSize: 1024
         # (Required) Types of logs to forward to Syslog (must specify at least one option)
         logTypes:
         - Audit
         - DNS
         - Flows
         - IDSEvents
   ```
   This can be done during installation by editing the custom-resources.yaml by applying it or after installation by editing the resource with the command:
   ```bash
   kubectl edit logcollector tigera-secure
   ```
2. You can control which types of $[prodname] log data you would like to send to syslog.
   The [Syslog section](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.SyslogStoreSpec)
   contains a field called `logTypes` which allows you to list which log types you would like to include.
   The allowable log types are:

   - Audit
   - DNS
   - Flows
   - IDSEvents

   Refer to the [Syslog section](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.SyslogStoreSpec) for more details on what data each log type represents.

   :::note

   The log type `IDSEvents` is only supported for a cluster that has [LogStorage](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.LogStorage) configured. It is because intrusion detection event data is pulled from the corresponding LogStorage datastore directly.

   :::

   The `logTypes` field is a required, which means you must specify at least one type of log to export to syslog.

**TLS configuration**

3. You can enable TLS option for syslog forwarding by including the "encryption" option in the [Syslog section](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.SyslogStoreSpec).

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: LogCollector
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   spec:
     additionalStores:
       syslog:
         # (Required) Syslog endpoint, in the format protocol://host:port
         endpoint: tcp://1.2.3.4:514
         # (Optional) If messages are being truncated set this field
         packetSize: 1024
         # (Optional) To Configure TLS mode
         encryption: TLS
         # (Required) Types of logs to forward to Syslog (must specify at least one option)
         logTypes:
         - Audit
         - DNS
         - Flows
         - IDSEvents
   ```

4. Using the self-signed CA with the field name tls.crt, create a configmap in the tigera-operator namespace named, syslog-ca. Example:

   :::note

   Skip this step if publicCA bundle is good enough to verify the server certificates.

   :::

   ```bash
   kubectl create configmap syslog-ca --from-file=tls.crt -n tigera-operator
   ```

**Support** In this release, only [Splunk Enterprise](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/splunk-enterprise.html) is supported.

$[prodname] uses Splunk's **HTTP Event Collector** to send data to Splunk server. To copy the flow, audit, and dns logs to Splunk, follow these steps:

1. Create a HTTP Event Collector token by following the steps listed in Splunk's documentation for your specific Splunk version. Here is the link to do this for [Splunk version 8.0.0](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.0/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector).

2. Create a Secret in the `tigera-operator` namespace named `logcollector-splunk-credentials` with the field `token`.
   Example:

   ```
    kubectl create secret generic logcollector-splunk-credentials \
    --from-literal=token=<splunk-hec-token> \
    -n tigera-operator
   ```

3. Update the
   [LogCollector](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.LogCollector)
   resource named `tigera-secure` to include
   a [Splunk section](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.SplunkStoreSpec)
   with your Splunk information.
   Example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: LogCollector
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   spec:
     additionalStores:
       splunk:
          # Splunk HTTP Event Collector endpoint, in the format protocol://host:port
         endpoint: https://1.2.3.4:8088
   ```

   This can be done during installation by editing the custom-resources.yaml
   by applying it or after installation by editing the resource with the command:

   ```
   kubectl edit logcollector tigera-secure
   ```
