{{site.prodname}} pushes BGP activity logs to Elasticsearch. To view them, go to the Discovery view, and from the dropdown menu, select `tigera_secure_ee_bgp.*` to view the collected BIRD and BIRD6 logs.
 
The following table details key/value pairs for constructing queries, including their Elasticsearch datatype.

| Name                  | Datatype          | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| `logtime`             | date              | When the log was collected in UTC timestamp format. |
| `host`                | keyword           | The name of the node where log was collected. |
| `ip_version`          | keyword           | Contains one of the following values:<br>&#x25cf;&nbsp;<code>IPv4</code>: Log from BIRD process <br>&#x25cf;&nbsp;<code>IPv6</code>: Log from BIRD6 process|
| `message`             | text              | The message contained in the log. |

Once a set of BGP logs has accumulated in Elasticsearch, you can perform many interesting queries. Depending on the field that you want to query, different techniques are required. For example:
* To view BGP logs only for IPv4 or IPv6, query on the `ip_version` field and sort by `logtime`
* To see all logs from a specific node, query on the `host` field
* To view events in the cluster, query on the `message` field
