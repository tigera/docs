### Format of the policies field

The `policies` field contains a comma-delimited list of policy rules that matched the flow.  Each entry in the
list has the following format:

```
<index>|<tier name>|<policy name>|<action>|<rule index>
```

Where,

* `<index>` numbers the order in which the rules were hit, starting with `0`.
  :::tip
  Sort the entries of the list by the `<index>` to see the order that rules were hit.  The entries are displayed in
  random order due to the way they are stored in the datastore.
  :::

* `<tier name>` is the name of the policy tier containing the policy, or `__PROFILE__` for a rule derived from a
  `Profile` resource (this is the internal datatype used to represent a Kubernetes namespace and its associated
  "default allow" rule).
* `<policy name>` is the name of the policy/profile; its format depends on the type of policy:

  * `<tier>.<name>` for {{prodname}} `GlobalNetworkPolicy`.
  * `<namespace>/knp.default.<name>` for Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`.
  * `<namespace>/<tier>.<name>` for {{prodname}} `NetworkPolicy`.

  Staged policy names are prefixed with "staged:".

* `<action>` is the action performed by the rule; one of `allow`, `deny`, `pass`.
* `<rule index>` if non-negative, is the index of the rule that was matched within the policy, starting with 0.
  Otherwise, a special value:

  * `-1` means the reporting endpoint was selected by the policy but no rule matched.  The traffic hit the default
    action for the tier.  In this case, the `<policy name>` is selected arbitrarily from the set of policies within
    the tier that apply to the endpoint.
  * `-2` means "unknown". The rule index was not recorded.
