### Big picture

Tour the main features of {{site.prodname}} Manager.

### Value

To move to production, Kubernetes workloads must meet existing organizational/regulatory security and compliance requirements. Downtime and connectivity issues in Kubernetes are not an option. One of the major obstacles cited to adopting Kubernetes is the lack of visibility into Kubernetes for all teams: security, networking, platform, devOps, and developers. 

With the {{site.prodname}} Manager user interface, your teams will gain confidence to:

- Implement security controls for compliance and reporting requirements
- Control access to endpoints outside the cluster, including fine-grained access controls to databases, services, and APIs
- Troubleshoot all network traffic with Kubernetes context, including connectivity issues

### Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{site.prodname}} features:

- **{{site.prodname}} Manager** with built-in Elasticsearch and Kibana 
- **Calico Enterprise API server**

### Concepts

#### Secure web client communications 

The {{site.prodname}} Manager is a web application for viewing and editing tiered {{site.prodname}} and Kubernetes network policies. Communications between {{site.prodname}} Manager, Kubernetes, and {{site.prodname}} API servers are secured using HTTPS over TLS (the `Secure` indicator in the web browser address bar.) 

#### Standard user authentication methods 

{{site.prodname}} Manager supports industry-standard user authentication methods (token, OIDC, OAuth, and basic) to configure user logins. To access resources, {{site.prodname}} uses standard Kubernetes-based authentication with the standard Kubernetes RBAC roles and role-bindings. Admins can create fine-grained access control to {{site.prodname}} and Kubernetes resources and actions (CRUD) to promote self-service.  

### Quick tour of Manager UI

#### Service graph

The Service graph provides a point-to-point, topographical representation of all traffic within your cluster. It allows DevOps, SREs, and platform operators to gain a rapid understanding of applications and services in their deployment. Highlights include:

- Select a node or edge to display details of the flow activity on the right-side panel, while automatically filtering and displaying source raw flow log data on the bottom panel 
- View details of flows and relationships between namespaces, services, and deployments 
- Create layers to manage scale by grouping resources in meaningful ways (for example, monitoring, infrastructure, storage, networking). Then, save the group to a view, and manage views with the show/hide toggle.

#### Policy dashboard: workloads, policies, and access guardrails made visible

**Sound familiar?**

Kubernetes does not provide a way to implement fine-grained access to resources outside the cluster, and firewall tools don’t help with Kubernetes dynamic IP addresses. 

**{{site.prodname}} solution**

Network policies are tiered (grouped) and visualized in a dashboard so you can see your security controls across all clusters and teams. Your security teams can see who can access what, at all times, in a central place.

#### Network policy lifecycle management

**Sound familiar?**

Network policies are difficult to create, and misconfiguration results in connectivity issues and outages. It is difficult to predict the effects of a change to network security policy. Our security team needs rock solid evidence of security controls, and our platform team wants a rock solid CI/CD process for network policies.

**{{site.prodname}} solution**

Security controls are built into every stage of your network policy lifecycle with these features: recommended policies, preview policy, and stage policy.

#### Network traffic flow visibility

**Sound familiar?**

Kubernetes network connectivity is difficult to triage and debug in security workflows. Kubernetes doesn’t natively log traffic, there is no visibility into Kubernetes contexts like namespace, pod, labels, and which policies evaluated traffic, and accepted/denied the connection. When connectivity breaks, it’s not possible to identify why. When a connection is denied, it’s impossible to identify which policy denied the traffic. Manually traversing syslogs on individual nodes doesn’t scale. 

**{{site.prodname}} solution**

{{site.prodname}} logs all network flows including source and destination namespaces, pods, labels, and the policies that evaluate each flow. Logs of all connection attempts (inside and outside the cluster) are automatically generated so you can quickly identify source of connectivity issues. 

The Flow Visualizer lets you quickly drill down and pinpoint which policies are allowing and denying traffic between their services.

#### Threat intelligence feeds

**Sound familiar?**

Threats are real and there seems to be no visibility into detecting suspicious behavior in Kubernetes clusters. It is not an option to wait until attacks are in progress. With IPs coming and going, isn’t suspicious behavior like finding a needle in a haystack?  
 
**Calico Enterprise solution**

{{site.prodname}} integrates with threat intelligence feeds so you can detect when your Kubernetes clusters communicate with suspicious IPs or domains. When communications are detected, an anomaly detection dashboard in the UI shows the full context, including which pod(s) were involved so you can analyze and remediate. You can also use a threat intelligence feed to power a dynamic blocklist, either to or from a specific group of sensitive pods, or your entire cluster.

#### Alert on anomalies

**Sound familiar?**

How do I know if I have an infected workload? Is it just drilling down into logs and Kibana to find them?

**{{site.prodname}} solution**

{{site.prodname}} detects and alerts on unexpected network behavior that can indicate a security breach. Alerts are generated for:

- Known attacks and exploits (for example, exploits found at Shopify, Tesla, Atlassian)
- DOS attempts
- Attempted connections to botnets and command and control servers
- Abnormal flow volumes or flow patterns using machine learning

The Tigera threat research team keeps {{site.prodname}}’s threat detection capabilities up to date, searching for new and known vulnerabilities.

#### Compliance reporting

**Sound familiar?**

Existing compliance tools that rely on periodic snapshots do not provide accurate assessment of the highly dynamic and ephemeral Kubernetes. Without monitoring, there is no visibility into network connectivity. Without logs, there’s no way to provide compliance with controls.
 
**{{site.prodname}} solution**

{{site.prodname}} provides predefined compliance reports (Inventory, Network Access, and Policy Audit), and CIS benchmark Level 1 and Level 2 reports. You can schedule reports for a complete inventory of regulated workloads with evidence of enforcement of network controls. The compliance dashboard lets you view and export reports from Elasticsearch. As always, you can use Kubernetes RBAC to grant permissions to manage reports.

#### Audit logs

**Sound familiar?**

Native Kubernetes doesn’t provide a way to easily capture audit logs for resources like pods, namespaces, service accounts, network policies, and endpoints. 
 
**{{site.prodname}} solution**

There’s nothing fancy about it, but audit logs are the way you can see changes to security controls over time (change history). Marry flow logs with audit logs to demonstrate adherence for compliance.
