# Calico Enterprise X.Y release notes

Intro text.

## New features and enhancements

### VXLAN encapsulation for cross-cluster connectivity

Added support for VXLAN overlay networking to federated endpoint indentity and services. Using VXLAN overlay networking alleviates the work of configuring routable pod CIDRs for cross-cluster connectivity, and provides a solution if IPs are exhausted. {{prodname}} uses the VXLAN overlay network to establish pod CIDR routes to remote nodes.

For more information, see [Configure federated endpoint identity and services](../multicluster/federation/kubeconfig).

### Helm installation and upgrade for multi-cluster management deployments

We've added the option to use Helm to install and upgrade if you are using the multi-cluster management feature. With Helm, your DevOps teams can automate these complex deployments more easily.

For more information, see [Helm for multi-cluster management](../multicluster/helm/).
