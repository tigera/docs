# Calico Enterprise 3.19 release notes

:::info early preview release

Calico Enterprise 3.19 can be used for previewing and testing purposes only.
It is not supported for use in production.

:::

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of {{prodname}}.

## New features and enhancements

### Improved flow log filtering for destination domains

Weâ€™ve updated the Felix parameter (`dest_domains`) to make it easy to find only domain names that the deployment actually connected to (not all the domain names that got translated to the same IP address), for use in a DNS policy.
For more information, see [Flow log data types](../visibility/elastic/flow/datatypes.mdx).

### Deprecated and removed features

* The anomaly detection feature has been removed in this release.

## Known issues

* TKG v1.x and MKE v3.6 are not supported at this time
* L7 logs with source name `pvt` is not visible in Service Graph
* *Multi-cluster management users only*. If the `manager-tls` and `internal-manager-tls` secrets have overlapping DNS names, components such as `es-calico-kube-controllers` will log certificate errors. If you have previously installed a version older than v3.13.0 and never changed your manager-tls secret from the tigera-operator namespace, you must delete both of these secrets. This applies to you if the following command prints a certificate: `$ kubectl get secret manager-tls -n tigera-operator -o "jsonpath={.data['cert']}"`
* Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.18.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed
