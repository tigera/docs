# Configure egress traffic to multiple external networks

## Big Picture

Allows workloads from different namespaces of a Kubernetes cluster to egress onto different external networks that (may) have overlapping IPs with each other.

## Value

When traffic from particular applications leaves the cluster to access an external destination, egress gateway enables users to control the source IP of that traffic. However, in this case, egress gateway sees all the external destinations as a flat L3 network. If a user has a network topology which involves multiple external networks and the service endpoints in those networks may have overlapping IPs, it becomes a manatory requirement that {{prodname}} should be able to direct the egress traffic to the service endpoint in the designated network.

For example, suppose a user has a network setup as blow:
There are two external networks (Red and Yellow) outside the cluster. A web server on network Red is exposing its service at `105.8.10.1`. A database server on network Yellow is exposing its service at `105.8.10.1` too.

Then the user could have the requirement as followings:
Pods in Red namespace should send traffic via egress gateways to `105.8.10.1` on external network Red.
Pods in Yellow namespace should send traffic via egress gateways to `105.8.10.1` on external network Yellow.

External network support is introduced into {{prodname}} in order to meet those requirements. It allows user to associate a egress gateway to external networks so that the egress traffic originated from the client via that egress gateway will be routed to the service endpoints on the associated external networks. In a word, external network feature supports L3 segmentation of the outgoing egress traffic.

## Prerequisites

- IPs on multiple external networks may overlapping with each other, however, those IPs do not overlap with the IPs of pods within the cluster or their hosts.
- IPs of the BGP peers peering with the cluster should not be overlapping.

## Limitations

- This feature should be used in the combination of egress gateway support. Sending traffic from a client pod to external networks without going through an egress gateway is not supported.
- This feature supports IPv4 only.

## Before you begin

These features require you to understand how to configured a functioning egress gateway deployment in a cluster. For more information on deploying egress gateways, [see our other egress gateway guides]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/egress/)

## Concepts

### Egress node
A node in the cluster which is peering with external networks and populating routes to direct traffic from the egress gateway to the destination on external networks. Any egress gateway which is associated to an external network should be scheduled to be running on a egress node.

### BGP bootstrap routes
BGP bootstrapping routes are routes on the node for traffic from that node to reach other nodes in the cluster, or other destinations outside the cluster, via whatever routers and external networks the customer wants. It is outside of the scope of {{prodname}} as {{prodname}} requires bootstrapping routes to be set up before peering with the router.

## How to

### Enable egress gateway support

In the default **FelixConfiguration**, set the `egressIPSupport` field to `EnabledPerNamespace` or
`EnabledPerNamespaceOrPerPod`, according to the level of support that you need in your cluster. For support on a per-namespace basis only:

```batch
kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default --type='merge' -p \
    '{"spec":{"egressIPSupport":"EnabledPerNamespace"}}'
```

Or for support both per-namespace and per-pod:

```batch
kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default --type='merge' -p \
    '{"spec":{"egressIPSupport":"EnabledPerNamespaceOrPerPod"}}'
```

### Enable external network support

In the default **FelixConfiguration**, set the `externalNetworkSupport` field to `Enabled`.

```batch
kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default --type='merge' -p \
    '{"spec":{"externalNetworkSupport":"Enabled"}}'
```

### Create external network resources 

Add an `ExternalNetwork` resource to the cluster for each external networks. For example, to create an `ExternalNetwork` for `red` network.

```batch
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: ExternalNetwork
metadata:
name: red
spec:
routeTableIndex: 500
EOF
```
:::note

Set `routeTableIndex` to the index of a linux kernel routing table that should be used for the routes associated with the external network. The value should be unique for each external network. The value should not be in the range of `RouteTableRanges` field in FelixConfiguration. The kernel routing table index should not be used by other processes on the node.

:::

{{prodname}} automatically picks up bootstrapping routes into the routing table used by an external network if those routes are pre-configured as a directly connected L2 route by the customer in the main routing table.
If the main routing table does not have the bootstrapping routes, the customer should pre-configure this routing table with bootstrapping routes on each egress node outside of Calico to include whatever routes are needed for Calico to reach the BGP peer.

### Label egress node

Add a label, e.g. `egress: true`, to select multiple nodes in the cluster and mark them as egress nodes.

- This label is used to satisfy the `nodeSelector` of the BGPPeer representing a BGP peer belongs to an external network.
- This label is also used to enforce egress gateway pods associated external networks to be running on egress nodes with the help of setting `nodeSelector` field in pod spec.

### Create BGP peers

For each external router on an external network, create a BGPPeer resource that peers between the egress nodes and the external router; specify the name of the network in the `ExternalNetwork` field of the BGPPeer resource; set `nodeSelector` to the label which selects egress nodes.

```batch
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
name: some.name
spec:
nodeSelector: "egress == 'true'"
peerIP: 172.31.11.1
asNumber: 63400
sourceAddress: None
externalNetwork: red
EOF
```

### Create egress gateways

Create an egress gateway deployment running on the egress nodes and use new annotation `egress.projectcalico.org/externalNetworkNames` to associate the egress gateway pods of the deployment with one or more networks as desired. [see our other egress gateway guides]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/egress/)

```batch
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: egress-gateway
  namespace: default
  labels:
    egress-code: red
spec:
  replicas: 1

        - name: EGRESS_POD_IP
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:

          capabilities:
            add:
            - NET_ADMIN
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/run
          name: policysync
        ports:
        - name: health
          containerPort: 8080

EOF
```

Where:
- Annotations `egress.projectcalico.org/externalNetworkNames: "[\"red\"]"` associates this egress gateway deployments with external network `red`. All traffic leaving the egress gateway to an external destination will be routed to the destination on external network `red`.
- Node selector `egress: true` forces egress gateway pods of the deployment to be scheduled on egress nodes.

:::note

If multiple networks in the `externalNetworkNames` list (of the egress gateway) advertise the same prefix to Calico then traffic to those prefixes will flow to a non-deterministic network. It is the user's responsibility to make sure it will never happen.

### Use egress gateways

Add annotations to namespaces or pods to configure them to use the relevant egress gateways created by the step above. Egress traffic from the application pods will be routed to destinations within the designated external networks.
