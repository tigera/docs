### Big picture

Automatically detect suspicious security activities within a cluster and generate alerts. 

### Value

{{site.prodname}} includes an anomaly detection engine that analyzes patterns and indicates potential 
threats and security issues. Security issues that are detected include threats like DGA, reconnaisance threats like IP sweep, but also issues with servers that can affect daily operations. To enable the anomaly detection engine, all you need to do is install anomaly detection within your cluster. If there are any security anomalies, you will automatically get alerts in the Manager UI.

### Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{site.prodname}} features:
- **Anomaly detection**

### Concepts 

#### About security anomalies

{{site.prodname}} anomaly detection detects anomalous behavior for patterns and 
alerts on them. This feature allows you to proactively determine if there is an issue (or not), and potentially 
resolve problems before service levels are compromised. Anomaly detection uses {{site.prodname}} Elasticsearch logs 
([flows]({{site.baseurl}}/visibility/elastic/flow) logs, [L7]({{site.baseurl}}/visibility/elastic/l7) logs, and [DNS]({{site.baseurl}}/visibility/elastic/dns) logs) to learn behavior of cluster nodes, pods, services, and other 
entities that send log records (applications, load balancers, databases, etc.).

Root causes of cluster security anomalies are numerous, for example:

**Malicious behaviors**
- DoS and crypto mining attacks

**Applications and microservices**
- Bugs in applications and microservices
- Underprovisioned applications (replicas)

**Network and infrastructure**
- Process or CPU overload due to surges in traffic 

#### About anomaly detection modeling

Anomaly detection uses a neural network and probabilistic time series modeling to automatically 
identify security anomalies associated with workloads in your cluster. It can also work as a daemon that 
periodically retrains the model and performs anomaly detection. Anomaly detections performs these 
high-level tasks:

- Learns the normal behaviour and patterns of cluster nodes, pods, services, and other entities that send log records 
(applications, load balancers, databases, etc.).
- Collects data from different cluster log fields (individual or aggregated) such as connections, 
bytes sent, latencies, and counters.
- Learns the time patterns (hourly, daily, or other) in field values. For example, there can be a peak 
in the connections to an authorization service in the morning, then a big data transmission when 
the database starts a backup operation.

For a list of security anomalies that are enabled by default, see [Anomaly detection reference]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/anomaly-detection/all-jobs-envars#security-anomaly-detectors).

### FAQ

**Do I need to configure anomaly values?**

>Anomalies are preconfigured with reasonable defaults that are optimized for performance and appropriate frequency and severity. You should not need to change the values unless you are getting too many alerts.  

**Will alerts be unusually high until the engine learns to distinguish normal from anomalous behavior?**

>Yes. If you have data for a cluster running several hours, that could result in an unusually high alert rate.

**If the engine detects more than one anomaly (ex. one in `flow` logs, and `DNS` logs), will I get separate alerts?**

>You can see several `suspicious_records` from different logs in the same alert if those records are presented in 
> the same time interval. Suspicious records in alert are grouped by log names.

**Where does anomaly detection run on multi-cluster management (mcm) deployments?**

>Anomaly detection runs on the management cluster, but users on managed clusters can enable/disable alerts.

- [Disable anomaly detectors](#disable-anomaly-detectors)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

#### Install anomaly detection

{% include /content/anomaly-detection/install-common.md %}

#### Monitor anomalies and alerts

{% include /content/anomaly-detection/monitor.md %}

#### Disable anomaly detectors

{% include /content/anomaly-detection/disable.md %}

#### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** I am getting too many alerts. What can I do?

**Solution:** The default values for anomaly detectors are configured for a reasonable amount of alerts. However, you can change values using [anomaly detection environment variables]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/anomaly-detection/all-jobs-envars). 

**Issue:** The Elasticsearch consumption is very high. How do I decrease it?

**Solution:** Decrease the maximum number of log records used for training using the [**AD_max_docs** variable]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/anomaly-detection/all-jobs-envars). Note that the more Elasticsearch log data is used in training of the model, the more accurate the anomaly detection. However, the more data the anomaly detection reads, the more costly it becomes in terms of data retention.
