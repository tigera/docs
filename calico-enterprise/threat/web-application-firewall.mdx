# Workload-based Web Application Firewall (WAF)

:::note

This feature is tech preview. Tech preview features may be subject to significant changes before they become GA.

:::

## Big picture

Protect cloud-native applications from application layer attacks with $[prodname] Workload-based Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## Value

Our workload-centric Web Application Firewall (WAF) protects your workloads from a variety of application layer attacks originating from within your cluster such as [SQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection). Given that attacks on apps are the [leading cause of breaches](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/application-protection-report-2019--episode-2--2018-breach-trend), you need to secure the HTTP traffic inside your cluster.

Historically, web application firewalls (WAFs) were deployed at the edge of your cluster to filter incoming traffic. Our workload-based WAF solution takes a unique, cloud-native approach to web security by allowing you to implement zero-trust rules for workloads inside your cluster.

## Concepts

### About $[prodname] WAF

WAF is deployed in your cluster with Envoy as a sidecar container on your pods. $[prodname] proxies traffic through Envoy, checking HTTP requests using the industry-standard
[ModSecurity](https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity-core-rule-set/) with OWASP Core Rule Set `v4.0.0-rc2` with some modifications for Kubernetes workloads.

You simply enable WAF in Manager UI, and determine the deployments that you want to enable for WAF protection. By default WAF is set to `DetectionOnly` so no traffic will be denied until you are ready to turn on blocking mode.

Every request that WAF finds an issue with, will result in a Security Event being created for [you to review in the UI](#view-waf-events), regardless of whether the traffic was allowed or denied. This can greatly help in tuning later.

#### How WAF determines if a request should be allowed or denied

If you configure WAF in blocking mode, WAF will use something called [anomaly scoring mode](https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/anomaly_scoring/) to determine if a request is allowed with `200 OK` or denied `403 Forbidden`.

This works by matching a single HTTP request against all the configured WAF rules. Each rule has a score and WAF adds all the matched rule scores together, and compares it to the overall anomaly threshold score (100 by default). If the score is under the threshold the request is allowed and if the score is over the threshold the request is denied. Our WAF starts in detection mode only and with a high default scoring threshold so is safe to turn on and then [fine-tune the WAF](#manage-your-waf) for your specific needs in your cluster.

## Before you begin

### Limitations

WAF cannot be used with:
* Host-networked client pods
* TLS traffic
* [LoadBalancer services](https://Kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer)
* Kubernetes 1.28 or earlier

:::note

When selecting and deselecting traffic for WAF, active connections may be disrupted.

:::

:::caution

You should enable WAF only for your application pods.
If you enable WAF for deployments that are part of the Kubernetes system itself, you may create an undesirable cluster state.

:::

## Enable WAF

### Enable WAF using the CLI

#### Enable the Policy Sync API in Felix

To enable WAF using the CLI, you must enable the Policy Sync API in Felix. To do this cluster-wide,
modify the `default` FelixConfiguration to set the field `policySyncPathPrefix` to `/var/run/nodeagent`:

```bash
kubectl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"policySyncPathPrefix":"/var/run/nodeagent"}}'
```

#### Enable WAF using kubectl

In the ApplicationLayer custom resource, named `tigera-secure`, set the `sidecarInjection` field to `Enabled`.

```bash
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: ApplicationLayer
metadata:
  name: tigera-secure
spec:
  sidecarInjection: Enabled
```

Or, in Manager UI, click **Threat Defense > Web Application Firewall > Configure Web Application Firewall**.

 <img src="/img/calico-enterprise/waf-config-first-step.png" alt="WAF services" width="600"/>

### (Optional) Deploy a sample application

If you don’t have an application to test WAF with or don’t want to use it right away against your own application,
we recommend that you install the [GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo app](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo):

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/main/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```

## Apply WAF to deployments

Now that you have deployed WAF in your cluster, you can select the deployments you want to protect from application layer attacks.

If you have deployed the sample application, you can apply WAF on a deployment associated with your app, as follows:

```bash
kubectl patch deployment frontend -n default -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{"applicationlayer.projectcalico.org/sidecar":"true"},"annotations":{"applicationlayer.projectcalico.org/waf":"Enabled"}}}}}'
```

Alternatively, you can use the Manager UI to apply WAF to the `frontend` deployment if you opted for sidecars.

In this example, we applied WAF to the `frontend` pods. This means that every request that goes through the `frontend` deployment is inspected.
However, the traffic is not blocked because the WAF rule is set to `DetectionOnly` by default. You can adjust rules and start blocking traffic by [fine-tuning your WAF](#manage-your-waf).

In the previous example, we applied WAF to the `frontend` deployment of the sample application. Here, we are
applying WAF to a deployment of your own application.

1. On the Manager UI, click **Threat Defense**, **Web Application Firewall**.
2. Select the deployments you want WAF to inspect, and then click **Confirm Selections**.

   <img
    src='/img/calico-enterprise/waf-select-services-3.17.png'
    alt='WAF services'
    width='600'
   />

3. On the **Web Application Firewall** page, you can verify that WAF is enabled for a deployment by locating the deployment and checking that the **Status** column says **Enabled**.

4. To make further changes to a deployment, click **Actions**, and then **Enable** or **Disable**.

You have now applied WAF rule sets to your own deployments, and note that the traffic that goes through the selected deployments will be alerted but not blocked by default.

### Trigger a WAF event

If you would like to trigger a WAF event for testing purposes, you can simulate an SQL injection attack inside your cluster by crafting a HTTP request with a query string that WAF will detect as an SQL injection attempt.
The query string in this example has some SQL syntax embedded in the text. This is harmless and for demo purposes, but WAF will detect this pattern and create an event for this HTTP request.

Run a simple curl command from any pod inside your cluster targeting a deployment you have selected for WAF protection e.g. from the demo app above we could attempt to send a simple HTTP request to the cartservice.
```
  curl http://cartservice/cart?artist=0+div+1+union%23foo*%2F*bar%0D%0Aselect%23foo%0D%0A1%2C2%2Ccurrent_user
```

## Manage WAF configuration

Reviewing the default rule set config:

```bash
Include @coraza.conf-recommended
Include @crs-setup.conf.example
Include @owasp_crs/*.conf

SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly
```

The configuration file starts with importing the appropriate rule set config. We use Coraza WAF's recommended [Core Rule Set setup](https://coraza.io/docs/tutorials/coreruleset/) files:

1. Coraza recommended [configuration](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza/blob/main/coraza.conf-recommended)
1. The rest of the [coreruleset](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset) files, currently [v4.0.0-rc2](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/tree/v4.0.0-rc2)

These files can be customized if desired. Add all your customizations directly under `tigera.conf`:

```bash
kubectl edit cm -n tigera-operator modsecurity-ruleset
``` 

After editing this ConfigMap successfully, the `modsecurity-ruleset` ConfigMap will be replaced in the `tigera-operator` namespace,
which then triggers a rolling restart of your L7 pods. This means that the HTTP connections going through L7 pods at the time of pod termination will be (RST) reset.

:::note

It is important to adhere to  the [Core Rule Set documentation](https://coreruleset.org/docs) on how to edit the behaviour of
 your WAF. A good place to begin at is the [Installing Core Rule Set](https://coreruleset.org/docs/deployment/install/).

In many scenarios, the default example CRS configuration will be a good enough starting point. It is recommended to review the example configuration file before
you deploy it to make sure it’s right for your environment.
:::

### Customization options

#### Set WAF to block traffic
By default WAF will not block a request even if it has matching rule violations. The rule engine is set to `DetectionOnly`. You can configure to block traffic instead with an `HTTP 403 Forbidden` response status code when the combined matched rules scores exceed a certain threshold.

1. Edit the configmap:
   ```bash
   kubectl edit cm -n tigera-operator modsecurity-ruleset
   ```
2. Look for `SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly` and change it to `SecRuleEngine On`.
3. Save your changes. This triggers a rolling update of the L7 pods.

| Action | Description                                                                                                                                                             | Disruptive? |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| DetectionOnly | Traffic is not denied nor dropped. $[prodname]  will log events. | No
| On     | Denies HTTP traffic. $[prodname]  will log the event in Security Events. | Yes          |
| Off    | Be cautious about using this option. Traffic is not denied, and there are no events. |No                                                                      | Yes         |

#### Other basic customizations

For basic customizations, it's best to add it after all the includes in `tigera.conf`. In fact, this is the reason why the `SecRuleEngine` directive and the rest of [our customizations](https://github.com/tigera/operator/blob/master/pkg/render/applicationlayer/embed/coreruleset/tigera.conf#L8-L17) are situated there.

An example is adding a sampling mode. For that, the `tigera.conf` will look like this:

```bash
# Core Rule Set activation
Include @coraza.conf-recommended
Include @crs-setup.conf.example
Include @owasp_crs/*.conf

SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly

# --- all customizations appear below this line, unless they need a specific loading order like plugins ---

# --- Add sampling mode
# Read about sampling mode here https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/sampling_mode/
SecAction "id:900400,\
  phase:1,\
  pass,\
  nolog,\
  setvar:tx.sampling_percentage=50"
```

Also you can disable certain rules here:

```bash
# --- disable 'Request content type is not allowed by policy'
SecRuleRemoveById 920420
```

Change anomaly scoring threshold:

```bash
  SecAction \
  "id:900110,\
  phase:1,\
  nolog,\
  pass,\
  t:none,\
  setvar:tx.inbound_anomaly_score_threshold=25,\
  setvar:tx.outbound_anomaly_score_threshold=20"
```

Or even change rule action parameters or behavior. For example:

 ```bash
 # --- append to more allowed content types to request bodies
SecAction \
  "id:900220,\
  phase:1,\
  nolog,\
  pass,\
  t:none,\
  setvar:'tx.allowed_request_content_type=|application/x-www-form-urlencoded| |multipart/form-data| |multipart/related| |text/xml| |application/xml| |application/soap+xml| |application/json| |application/cloudevents+json| |application/cloudevents-batch+json| |application/grpc|'"
```

#### Using Core Rule Set plugins

Let's go with an example plugin: [Wordpress Rule Exclusions](https://github.com/coreruleset/wordpress-rule-exclusions-plugin/).

Plugin files are the following:

```
wordpress-rule-exclusions-before.conf
wordpress-rule-exclusions-config.conf
```

To include these files properly, structure your work directory like so:

```
tigera.conf
wordpress-rule-exclusions-before.conf
wordpress-rule-exclusions-config.conf
```

and then `tigera.conf` contents should be:

```bash
Include @coraza.conf-recommended

Include /etc/modsecurity-ruleset/wordpress-rule-exclusions-config.conf
Include /etc/modsecurity-ruleset/wordpress-rule-exclusions-before.conf

Include @crs-setup.conf.example
Include @owasp_crs/*.conf

# if your plugin has an -after.conf, include them here
# but wordpress rule exclusions doesn't so we're adding a comment placeholder
# Include /etc/modsecurity-ruleset/wordpress-rule-exclusions-after.conf

SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly
```

Then create and apply the configmap:

```bash
## create the configuration map itself
kubectl create cm --dry-run=client \
  --from-file=tigera.conf \
  --from-file=wordpress-rule-exclusions-config.conf \
  --from-file=wordpress-rule-exclusions-before.conf \
  -n tigera-operator modsecurity-ruleset -o yaml  > rule set.configmap.yaml

## replace active configmap
kubectl replace -f rule set.configmap.yaml
```

Read more about the order of execution for plugins here: https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/plugins/

## View WAF events

### Security Events

To view WAF events in a centralized security events dashboard, go to: **Threat defense**, **Security Events**. For help, see [Security Event Management](../threat/security-event-management).

### Kibana

To view WAF events In Kibana, select the `tigera_secure_ee_waf*` index pattern.

### Disable WAF for a deployment

To disable WAF on a deployment, use the Actions menu on the WAF board, or use the following command:

```bash
kubectl patch deployment <deployment-name> -n <deployment-namespace> --type='json' -p '[{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/template/metadata/labels/applicationlayer.projectcalico.org~1sidecar"},{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/template/metadata/annotations/applicationlayer.projectcalico.org~1waf"}]'
```

## Disable WAF feature from your cluster

To safely disable WAF, determine how to handle ApplicationLayer features and follow the steps:

### Disable all ApplicationLayer features, including WAF

```bash
kubectl delete applicationlayer tigera-secure
```

### Keep some ApplicationLayer features enabled

To disable WAF but keep some ApplicationLayer features enabled, you must update the [ApplicationLayer](../reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.ApplicationLayer) custom resource.

Note that the [ApplicationLayer Specification](../reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.ApplicationLayerSpec) can specify configuration for [Application Logging](../reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.LogCollectionSpec) and [Application Layer Policy](../reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.ApplicationLayerPolicyStatusType) also. 

For the ApplicationLayer custom resource to be valid, at least one of these features have to be enabled, for example:


#### Valid YAML

WAF enabled, ALP disabled, and Log collection is unspecified (and the default is disabled)

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: ApplicationLayer
metadata:
  name: tigera-secure
spec:
  webApplicationFirewall: Disabled
  applicationLayerPolicy: Enabled
  sidecarInjection: Disabled
```

##### Invalid YAML

WAF and ALP both set as disabled, log collection is unspecified (and the default is disabled)
```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: ApplicationLayer
metadata:
  name: tigera-secure
spec:
  webApplicationFirewall: Disabled
  applicationLayerPolicy: Disabled
  sidecarInjection: Disabled
```
