The following anomaly detection jobs are included in {{site.prodname}}.

### IP Sweep detection
**Job ID**: `ip_sweep`

The job looks for pods in your cluster that are sending packets to many destinations. This may indicate
an attacker has gained control of a pod and is gathering reconnaissance on what else they can reach. The job
compares pods both with other pods in their replica set, and with other pods in the cluster generally. 

### Port Scan detection
**Job ID**: `port_scan`

The job looks for pods in your cluster that are sending packets to one destination on multiple ports. This may indicate
an attacker has gained control of a pod and is gathering reconnaissance on what else they can reach. The job
compares pods both with other pods in their replica set, and with other pods in the cluster generally.

### Inbound Service bytes anomaly 
**Job ID**: `bytes_in`

The job looks for services that receive an anomalously high amount of data.  This could indicate a
denial of service attack, data exfiltration, or other attacks. The job looks for services that are unusual
with respect to their replica set, and replica sets which are unusual with respect to the rest of the cluster.

### Outbound Service bytes anomaly 
**Job ID**: `bytes_out`

The job looks for pods that send an anomalously high amount of data.  This could indicate a
denial of service attack, data exfiltration, or other attacks. The job looks for pods that are unusual
with respect to their replica set, and replica sets which are unusual with respect to the rest of the cluster.

### Process restarts anomaly 
**Job ID**: `process_restarts`

Looks for pods with excessive number of the process restarts.  This could indicate problems with the processes, 
as resource problems or attacks. The job looks for pods that are unusual with respect to their process restart 
behavior.

### DNS Latency anomaly 
**Job ID**: `dns_latency`

The job looks for the clients that have too high latency of the DNS requests. This could indicate a 
denial of service attack.


### L7 Latency anomaly 
**Job ID**: `l7_latency`

The job looks for the pods that have too high latency of the L7 requests. All HTTP requests measured here. 
This anomaly could indicate a denial of service attack or other attacks.


### HTTP connection spike anomaly 
**Job ID**: `http_connection_spike`

The job looks for the services that get too many HTTP inbound connections.
This anomaly could indicate a denial of service attack.


### Domain Generation Algorithms detection 
**Job ID**: `dga`

The job looks for the domain names that could be created by the Domain Generation Algorithms.
The [Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA)] are frequently used by the malware. 
Generated domain names (URLs) are used to communicate between the malware code and the malware servers.
Presence of the DGA could indicate presence of the malware code.


### flows log anomaly 
**Job ID**: `generic_flows`

The job looks for several numeric fields in the `flows` log.
It detects the excessive values of the fields.
This anomaly could indicate a denial of service attack, data exfiltration, or other attacks.


### DNS log anomaly 
**Job ID**: `generic_dns`

The job looks for several numeric fields in the `DNS` log.
It detects the excessive values of the fields.
This anomaly could indicate a denial of service attack, data exfiltration, or other attacks.


### L7 log anomaly 
**Job ID**: `generic_l7`

The job looks for several numeric fields in the `L7` log.
It detects the excessive values of the fields.
This anomaly could indicate a denial of service attack, data exfiltration, or other attacks.


### L7 bytes anomaly 
**Job ID**: `l7_bytes`

The job looks for services that receive and/or send an anomalously high amount of data.  
This could indicate a denial of service attack, data exfiltration, or other attacks.
