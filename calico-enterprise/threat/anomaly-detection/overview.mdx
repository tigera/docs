{{site.prodname}} includes software that analyzes the logs of network communications
in your cluster [flow logs] to detect anomalies that may indicate that your network or cluster is compromised.  As it depends on flow logs, it is supported on Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters.

The Anomaly Detection jobs run periodically without any human intervention.
Jobs send the alerts for the detected anomalies.
