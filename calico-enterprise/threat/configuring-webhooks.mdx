# Webhooks for security event alerts

You can configure $[prodname] webhooks to post security alerts directly to Slack, Jira, Alertmanager, or any custom HTTP endpoint.

## Before you begin

Your target application must be configured to receive data from the $[prodname] webhook.

* **Slack**. You must have a webhook URL for the Slack app that you want $[prodname] to send alerts to.
  See [Sending messages using Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for more information.
* **Jira**. You must have an API token for an Atlassian user account that has write permissions to your Jira instance.
  See [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) for details on how to obtain an API token.
  You also need:
  * Your Atlassian site URL. If you access Jira at the URL `https://<your-company>.atlassian.net/jira`, then your site URL is `<your-company>.atlassian.net`.
  * A Jira project key. This is the Jira project where your $[prodname] webhook creates new issues. This user associated with your API token must have write permissions to this project.
* **Alertmanager** You must have a webhook URL for your Alertmanager instance to send alerts to. Optionally you can also configure authentication if needed.
  The URL for an Alertmanager service accessible from within your cluster may look as follows: `http://<alertmanager-service>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:9093/api/v2/alerts`.
  See [Alertmanager | Prometheus] (https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/Alertmanager/) for more information.
* **Generic JSON**. You must have a webhook URL for any other application you want the $[prodname] webhook to send alerts to.

## Create a webhook for security event alerts

1. In the web console, select **Activity** > **Webhooks**, and then click **Create your first webhook**.
2. Enter a **Name** for your webhook, select which **Event types** you want to get alerts for, and, under **Type**, select whether to configure the webhook for Slack, Jira, Alertmanager, or for generic JSON output.
3. Complete the fields for your webhook type and click **Create Webhook**.
4. To check that your webhook is working, find the webhook on the **Webhooks** page and click **Actions > Test Webhook**.
   If your webhook is set up correctly, you should generate a HTTP response.

   ```bash title="Example: Successful HTTP response"
   200 OK
   Webhook sent successfully
   ```
