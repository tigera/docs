# Webhooks for security event alerts

You can configure {{prodname}} webhooks to post security alerts directly to Slack, Jira, or any custom HTTP endpoint.

## Before you begin

Your target application must be configured to receive data from the {{prodname}} webhook.

* **Slack**. You must have a webhook URL for the Slack app that you want {{prodname}} to send alerts to.
See [Sending messages using Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for more information.
* **Jira**. You must have an API token for an Atlassian user account that has write permissions to your Jira instance.
  See [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) for details on how to obtain an API token.
  You also need:
  * Your Atlassian site URL. If you access Jira at the URL `https://<your-company>.atlassian.net/jira`, then your site URL is `<your-company>.atlassian.net`.
  * A Jira project key. This is the Jira project where your {{prodname}} webhook creates new issues. This user associated with your API token must have write permissions to this project.
* **Generic JSON**. You must have a webhook URL for any other application you want the {{prodname}} webhook to send alerts to.

## Create a webhook for security event alerts

1. In Manager UI, select **Activity** > **Webhooks**, and then click **Create your first webhook**.
2. Enter a **Name** for your webhook, select which **Event types** you want to get alerts for, and, under **Type**, select whether to configure the webhook for Slack, Jira, or for generic JSON output.
3. Complete the fields for your webhook type and click **Create Webhook**.
4. To check that your webhook is working, find the webhook on the **Webhooks** page and click **Actions > Test Webhook**.
   If your webhook is set up correctly, you should generate a HTTP response.

   ```bash title="Example: Successful HTTP response"
   200 OK
   Webhook sent successfully
   ```
