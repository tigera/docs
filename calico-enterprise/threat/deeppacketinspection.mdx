# Deep packet inspection

## Big picture

Configure deep packet inspection (DPI) in clusters to get alerts on compromised resources.

## Value

Security teams need to run DPI quickly in response to unusual network traffic in clusters so they can identify potential threats.
Also, it is critical to run DPI on select workloads (not all) to efficiently make use of cluster resources and minimize the impact of false positives.
$[prodname] provides an easy way to perform DPI using [Snort community rules](https://www.snort.org/downloads/#rule-downloads).
You can disable DPI at any time, selectively configure for namespaces and endpoints, and alerts are generated in the Alerts dashboard in Manager UI.

## Concepts

For each deep packet inspection resource (DeepPacketInspection), $[prodname] creates a live network monitor that inspects the header and payload information of packets that match the Snort community rules.
Whenever malicious activities are suspected, an alert is automatically added to the Security Events page in the $[prodname] web console.

$[prodname] DPI uses AF_PACKET, a Linux socket that allows an application to receive and send raw packets.
It is commonly used for troubleshooting (like tcpdump and Wireshark), but also for network intrusion detection. For details, see [AF_Packet](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/packet.7.html).

## Before you begin

**Not supported:**

- Multi-nic setup
- $[prodname] nodes running Windows hosts

## How To

- [Configure deep packet inspection](#configure-deep-packet-inspection)
- [Configure resource requirements](#configure-resource-requirements)
- [Access alerts](#access-alerts)
- [Verify deep packet inspection is running](#verify-deep-packet-inspection-is-running)

### Configure deep packet inspection

Create a YAML file containing one or more [DeepPacketInspection](../reference/resources/deeppacketinspection.mdx) resources and apply it to your cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f <your_deep_packet_inspection_filename>
```

To stop deep packet inspection, delete the DeepPacketInspection resource from your cluster.

```bash
kubectl delete -f <your_deep_packet_inspection_filename>
```

**Examples of selecting workloads**

Following is a basic example that selects a single workload that has the label `k8s-app` with the value `nginx`.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: DeepPacketInspection
metadata:
  name: sample-dpi-nginx
  namespace: sample
spec:
  selector: k8s-app == "nginx"
```

In the following example, we select all workload endpoints in the `sample` namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: DeepPacketInspection
metadata:
  name: sample-dpi-all
  namespace: sample
spec:
  selector: all()
```

### Configure resource requirements

Adjust the CPU and RAM used for performing deep packet inspection by updating the [component resource in IntrusionDetection](../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.IntrusionDetectionComponentResource).

For a data transfer rate of 1GB/sec on workload endpoints being monitored, we recommend a minimum of 1 CPU and 1GB RAM.

The following example configures deep packet inspection to use a maximum of 1 CPU and 1GB RAM.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: IntrusionDetection
metadata:
  name: tigera-secure
spec:
  componentResources:
    - componentName: DeepPacketInspection
      resourceRequirements:
        limits:
          cpu: '1'
          memory: 1Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100Mi
```

### Access alerts

The alerts generated by deep packet inspection are available in the Manager UI in the Alerts page.

### Verify deep packet inspection is running

Get the [status of DeepPacketInspection](../reference/resources/deeppacketinspection.mdx#status) resource to verify if live traffic is being monitored on selected workload endpoints.

```bash
kubectl get <deep_packet_inspection_resource_name> -n <deep_packet_inspection_namespace>
```

### Install custom Snort rules

If you don't want to use the [Snort community rules](https://www.snort.org/downloads/#rule-downloads), you can install a custom set of Snort rules to perform deep packet inspections.
You may want to install your own rules if:
* you use a paid subscription to a Snort ruleset
* you have written your own Snort rules.

:::important
If you install custom Snort rules, $[prodname] will stop updating the community rules with each minor release.
You will be responsible for making sure your rules are up to date.
:::

1. Create a container with your custom Snort rules.

   1. Copy your Snort rule files into a new `./snort-rules/` directory.
   1. Create a `Dockerfile` like this one:

      ```yaml
      FROM alpine:3.14
      COPY snort-rules /snort-rules
      ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "cp /snort-rules/* /usr/etc/snort/rules/" ]
      ```
   1. In the console, run the following commands:

      ```bash
      docker build . -t <your-image-name>:<your-image-tag>
      docker push <your-image-name>:<your-image-tag>
      ```

      After the image has been pushed to the registry, you're ready to configure the `IntrusionDetection` resource.

1. Update the `IntrusionDetection` resource with the custom Snort rules image.

   ```yaml
   spec:
     deepPacketInspectionDaemonset:
       spec:
         template:
           spec:
             initContainers:
             - name: snort-rules
               image: <your-image-name>:<your-image-tag>
   ```

  This can also be done by running the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl patch intrusiondetection tigera-secure --type merge -p '{"spec":{"deepPacketInspectionDaemonset":{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"initContainers":[{"name":"snort-rules", "image":"<your-image-name>:<your-image-tag>"}]}}}}}}'
  ```

1. Verify that your custom rules have been installed correctly:

   1. If it's not running already, [apply the DeepPacketInspection resource(#configure-deep-packet-inspection) to your cluster.
   1. Extract the list of Snort rules that are currently being used by running the following commands:

      ```bash
      export POD=$(kubectl get pods -n tigera-dpi -o custom-columns=:metadata.name --no-headers | head -n 1) \
      kubectl exec -n tigera-dpi $POD -- tar -cf - /usr/etc/snort/rules | tar --strip-components=4 -xf -
      ```

   1. If these rules match those in your custom set, then the installation was successful.
