## Going into production with {{prodname}}

It is not easy navigating the cultural shifts that come with adopting Kubernetes. Tigera's **Customer Success** has spent many years working with enterprise companies in highly-regulated industries to understand the sticking points that stall going into production. Common hurdles seen during pre-production are:

- Troubleshooting in Kubernetes across teams (cluster and pod failures, apps failures, and security breaches/attacks)
- Writing policy with granular security controls for workloads
- Ensuring security team requirements are met while allowing developer self-service with guardrails
- Implementing compliance controls

Tigera's Customer Success has invested heavily in custom and self-service training to address these obstacles. Guided by their best-practices-to-production workflows, you can keep progressing and join the growing list of companies who are in production with {{prodname}}.
