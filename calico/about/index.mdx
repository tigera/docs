# About Calico 

## What is {{prodname}}?

{{prodname}} is a networking and security solution that enables Kubernetes workloads and non-Kubernetes/legacy workloads to communicate seamlessly and securely. 

## Components and features

In Kubernetes, the default for networking traffic to/from pods is default-allow. If you do not lock down network connectivity using network policy, then all pods can communicate freely with other pods. 

{{prodname}} consists of **networking** to secure network communication, and advanced **network policy** to secure cloud-native microservices/applications at scale.

| Component                                                | **Description**                                              | Main features                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **{{prodname}} CNI** for networking                       | {{prodname}} CNI is a control plane that programs several dataplanes. It is an L3/L4 networking solution that secure containers, Kubernetes clusters, virtual machines, and native host-based workloads. | &bull; Built-in data encryption<br />&bull; Advanced IPAM management<br />&bull; Overlay and non-overlay networking options<br />&bull; Choice of dataplanes: iptables, eBPF, Windows HNS, or VPP |
| **{{prodname}} network policy suite** for network policy | {{prodname}} network policy suite is an interface to the {{prodname}} CNI that contains rules for the dataplane to execute.  <br /><br />{{prodname}} network policy:<br />&bull; Is designed with a zero-trust security model (deny-all, allow only where needed) <br />&bull; Integrates with the Kubernetes API server (so you can still use Kubernetes network policy) &bull;  Supports legacy systems (bare metal, non-cluster hosts) using the same network policy model. | &bull; **Namespace** and **global** policy to allow/deny traffic within a cluster, between pods and the outside world, and for non-cluster hosts.<br /><br />&bull; **Network sets** (an arbitrary set of IP subnetworks, CIDRs, or domains) to limit IP ranges for egress and ingress traffic to workloads.<br /><br />&bull; **Application layer (L7) policy** to enforce traffic using attributes like HTTP methods, paths, and cryptographically-secure identities. |

## {{prodname}} deployment options

{{prodname}} **networking** and **network policy** are most powerful when used together, but they are both offered separately for the widest adoption across platforms. Here are common {{prodname}} deployments. 

| Deployment options                      | Examples                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Self-managed Kubernetes, on-premises    | Kubernetes/kubeadm cluster                                 |
| Managed Kubernetes on public cloud      | EKS, GKE, IKS, AKS                                         |
| Self-managed Kubernetes on public cloud | AWS, GCE, Azure, Digital Ocean                             |
| Self-managed Kubernetes distributions   | OpenShift, AKS on Azure stack, Mirantis (MKE), RKE, VMware |
| Integrations                            | OpenStack, Flannel                                         |
| Bare metal, non-cluster hosts           |                                                            |
| Windows Kubernetes clusters             |                                                            |
