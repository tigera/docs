# Prometheus metrics

Felix can be configured to report a number of metrics through Prometheus. See the
[configuration reference](configuration.mdx) for how to enable metrics reporting.

## Metric reference

### Felix specific

Felix exports a number of Prometheus metrics. The current set is as follows. Since some metrics
are tied to particular implementation choices inside Felix we can't make any hard guarantees that
metrics will persist across releases. However, we aim not to make any spurious changes to
existing metrics.

#### Cluster-wide metrics

Prometheus metrics are self-documenting, with metrics turned on, `curl` can be used to list the
metrics along with their help text and type information.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9091/metrics | head
```

### Label indexing metrics

The label index is a subcomponent of Felix that is responsible for calculating the set of endpoints and network sets
that match each selector that is in an active policy rule.  Policy rules are active on a particular node if the policy
they belong to selects a workload or host endpoint on that node with its top-level selector (in `spec.selector`).
Inactive policies have minimal CPU cost because their selectors do not get indexed.

Since the label index must match the active selectors against _all_ endpoints and network sets in the cluster, its
performance is critical and it supports various optimizations to minimize CPU usage.  Its metrics can be used to
check that the optimizations are active for your policy set.

#### `felix_label_index_num_endpoints`

Reports the total number of endpoints (and similar objects such as network sets) being tracked by the index.
This should match the number of endpoints and network sets in your cluster.

#### `felix_label_index_num_active_selectors{optimized="true|false"}`

Reports the total number of active selectors, broken into `optimized="true"` and `optimized="false"` sub-totals.

The `optimized="true"` total tracks the number of selectors that the label index was able to optimize.  Those
selectors should be calculated efficiently even in clusters with hundreds of thousands of endpoints.  In general the
CPU used to calculate them should be proportional to the number of endpoints that match them and the churn rate of
_those_ endpoints.

The `optimized="false"` total tracks the number of selectors that could not be optimized.  Unoptimized selectors are
much more costly to calculate; the CPU used to calculate them is proportional to the number of endpoints
in the cluster and their churn rate.  It is generally OK to have a handful of unoptimized selectors,
but if many selectors are unoptimized the CPU usage can be substantial at high scale.

For more information on writing selectors that can be optimized, see the [this](../resources/networkpolicy.mdx#selector-performance-in-entityrules)
section of the `NetworkPolicy` reference.

#### `felix_label_index_selector_evals{result="true|false"}`

Counts the total number of times that a selector was evaluated vs an endpoint to determine if it matches, broken
down by match (`true`) or no-match (`false`).  The ratio of match to no-match shows how effective the selector
indexing optimizations are for your policy set.  The more effectively the label index can optimize the selectors,
the fewer "no-match" results it will report relative to "match".

If you have more than a handful of active selectors and `felix_label_index_selector_evals{result="false"}` is many
times `felix_label_index_selector_evals{result="true"}` then it is likely that some selectors in the policy set are
not being optimized effectively.

#### `felix_label_index_strategy_evals{strategy="..."}`

This is a technical statistic that shows how many times the label index has employed each optimization
strategy that it has available.  The strategies will likely evolve over time but, at time of writing, they are
as follows:

- `endpoint-full-scan`: the least efficient fall back strategy for unoptimized selectors. The index
  scanned _all_ endpoints to find the matches for a selector.

- `endpoint|parent-no-match`: the most efficient strategy; the index was able to prove that nothing matched the
  selector so it was able to skip the scan entirely.

- `endpoint|parent-single-value`: the label index was able to limit the scan to only those endpoints/parents that
  have a particular label and value combination.  For example, selector `label == "value"` would only scan items that
  had exactly that label set to "value".

- `endpoint|parent-multi-value`: the label index was able to limit the scan to only those endpoints/parents that
  have a particular label and one of a few values.  For example, selector `label in {"a", "b")` would only scan items
  that had exactly that label with one of the given values.

- `endpoint|parent-label-name`: the label index was able to limit the scan to only those endpoints/parents that
  hava a particular label (but was unable to limit it to a particular subset of values).  For example, `has(label)`
  would result in that kind of scan.

Terminology: here "endpoint" means "endpoint or NetworkSet" and "parent" is Felix's internal name for resources like
Kubernetes Namespaces.  A "parent" scan means that the label index scanned all endpoints that have a parent
matching the strategy.
