# Configure an ingress gateway

## Big picture

Enable support for the Kubernetes Gateway API.

:::note

This feature is tech preview. Tech preview features may be subject to significant changes before they become GA.

:::

## Value

$[prodname] includes support for the Kubernetes Gateway API, which allows advanced routing to services in a cluster, including weighted or blue-green load balancing.

## Concepts

### Gateway API

The Gateway API is an official Kubernetes API for advanced routing to services in a cluster.  To read about its use cases, structure and design, please see [the official docs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).  $[prodname] provides the following resources and versions of the Gateway API.

| Resource         | Versions          |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| BackendLBPolicy  | v1alpha2          |
| BackendTLSPolicy | v1alpha3          |
| GatewayClass     | v1, v1beta1       |
| Gateway          | v1, v1beta1       |
| GRPCRoute        | v1, v1alpha2      |
| HTTPRoute        | v1, v1beta1       |
| ReferenceGrant   | v1beta1, v1alpha2 |
| TCPRoute         | v1alpha2          |
| TLSRoute         | v1alpha2          |
| UDPRoute         | v1alpha2          |

### Envoy Gateway

Several implementations of the Gateway API are available, one of which is the [Envoy Gateway](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/).  $[prodname] integrates the Envoy Gateway implementation in order to provide support for the Gateway API.

### Access into a cluster from outside

The Gateway API only provides access into a cluster from outside when the cluster is _also_ provisioned to support Kubernetes Services with `type: LoadBalancer`.  When a Gateway is configured, $[prodname] creates a Deployment that does the actual work of routing and load balancing, etc., and a Service with `type: LoadBalancer` that fronts that Deployment.  If the cluster has a `type: LoadBalancer` provider, it will then allocate an IP outside the cluster and arrange for requests to that IP to be forwarded to the Gateway Service.

Managed Kubernetes services like AKS, EKS and GKE include a `type: LoadBalancer` provider that automatically integrates with Azure, AWS and GCP respectively.  On-prem clusters and non-managed clusters in the cloud need to set up their own `type: LoadBalancer` support.

## How to

- [Enable Gateway API support](#enable-gateway-api-support)
- [Use the Gateway API](#use-the-gateway-api)
- [Disable Gateway API support](#disable-gateway-api-support)
- [Customize Gateway deployment and features](#customize-gateway-deployment-and-features)

### Enable Gateway API support

To enable Gateway API support, create a `GatewayAPI` resource with name `default`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: GatewayAPI
metadata:
  name: default
EOF
```

Shortly after this you will see that Gateway API resources are now available:

```bash
kubectl api-resources | grep gateway.networking.k8s.io
```

```
backendlbpolicies                   blbpolicy                                       gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2          true         BackendLBPolicy
backendtlspolicies                  btlspolicy                                      gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha3          true         BackendTLSPolicy
gatewayclasses                      gc                                              gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1                false        GatewayClass
gateways                            gtw                                             gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1                true         Gateway
grpcroutes                                                                          gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1                true         GRPCRoute
httproutes                                                                          gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1                true         HTTPRoute

tcproutes                                                                           gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2          true         TCPRoute
tlsroutes                                                                           gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2          true         TLSRoute
udproutes                                                                           gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2          true         UDPRoute
```

And also that there is a GatewayClass resource corresponding to the Envoy Gateway implementation included in $[prodname]:

```bash
kubectl get gatewayclass -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].spec}' | jq
```

```
{
  "controllerName": "gateway.envoyproxy.io/gatewayclass-controller",
  "parametersRef": {
    "group": "gateway.envoyproxy.io",
    "kind": "EnvoyProxy",
    "name": "envoy-proxy-config",
    "namespace": "tigera-gateway"
  }
}
```

### Use the Gateway API

Now you can use the Gateway API in any way that the API supports.  When configuring a Gateway resource, be sure to specify `gatewayClassName: tigera-gateway-class`.

By way of a simple example:

- Create echo servers in namespaces `ns1` and `ns2`:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata:
    name: ns1
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: echoserver-ns1
    namespace: ns1
    labels:
      app: echoserver
  spec:
    containers:
    - image: ealen/echo-server:latest
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      name: echoserver
      ports:
      - containerPort: 80
      env:
      - name: PORT
        value: "80"
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: echoserver
    namespace: ns1
  spec:
    ports:
      - port: 80
        targetPort: 80
        protocol: TCP
    type: ClusterIP
    selector:
      app: echoserver
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata:
    name: ns2
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: echoserver-ns2
    namespace: ns2
    labels:
      app: echoserver
  spec:
    containers:
    - image: ealen/echo-server:latest
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      name: echoserver
      ports:
      - containerPort: 80
      env:
      - name: PORT
        value: "80"
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: echoserver
    namespace: ns2
  spec:
    ports:
      - port: 80
        targetPort: 80
        protocol: TCP
    type: ClusterIP
    selector:
      app: echoserver
  EOF
  ```

- Create a client pod that we can test from:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: test-client
  spec:
    containers:
    - args:
      - "3600"
      command:
      - /bin/sleep
      image: ubuntu
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      name: c1
    terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
  EOF
  ```

- Once that pod is running, install `curl` in it:

  ```bash
  kubectl exec -it test-client -- apt-get -y update
  kubectl exec -it test-client -- apt-get -y install curl
  ```

- Configure a Gateway:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Gateway
  metadata:
    name: eg
  spec:
    gatewayClassName: tigera-gateway-class
    listeners:
      - name: http
        protocol: HTTP
        port: 80
  EOF
  ```

- Configure routes to the two echo servers:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: HTTPRoute
  metadata:
    name: ns1-2-echo
  spec:
    parentRefs:
      - name: eg
    rules:
      - backendRefs:
          - group: ""
            kind: Service
            name: echoserver
            namespace: ns1
            port: 80
            weight: 1
        matches:
          - path:
              type: PathPrefix
              value: /ns1
      - backendRefs:
          - group: ""
            kind: Service
            name: echoserver
            namespace: ns2
            port: 80
            weight: 1
        matches:
          - path:
              type: PathPrefix
              value: /ns2
  EOF
  ```

- Configure the ReferenceGrants that are needed to allow the Gateway to reference services in other namespaces:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
  kind: ReferenceGrant
  metadata:
    name: echo
    namespace: ns1
  spec:
    from:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
      namespace: default
    to:
    - group: ""
      kind: Service
  ---
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
  kind: ReferenceGrant
  metadata:
    name: echo
    namespace: ns2
  spec:
    from:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
      namespace: default
    to:
    - group: ""
      kind: Service
  EOF
  ```

- Find the cluster IP of the Gateway Service:

  ```bash
  kubectl get services -n tigera-gateway
  ```

  ```
  NAME                        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                                   AGE
  envoy-default-eg-e41e7b31   LoadBalancer   10.0.20.19   135.232.51.10   80:32636/TCP                              9m3s
  envoy-gateway               ClusterIP      10.0.24.12   <none>          18000/TCP,18001/TCP,18002/TCP,19001/TCP   36m
  ```

  The Service for the Gateway is the one beginning with `envoy-default-`, followed by the name of the Gateway resource.  So the correct cluster IP in this case is 10.0.20.19.  (The `envoy-gateway` Service represents the gateway controller, which is the component that monitors for Gateway API resources and creates corresponding components to implement those.)

- Curl from the test client pod to a URL that should be handled by the echo server in namespace `ns1`, via the Gateway:

  ```bash
  kubectl exec -it test-client -- curl http://10.0.20.19/ns1/subpath?query=demo | jq
  ```

- The output confirms - see the `"HOSTNAME"` line - that the request was handled by the echo server in namespace `ns1`:

  ```
  {
    "host": {
      "hostname": "10.0.20.19",
      "ip": "::ffff:10.224.0.10",

    },

        "x-request-id": "375a5b78-60fc-4a87-89b0-b4c6501115ca"
      }
    },
    "environment": {
      "PATH": "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
      "HOSTNAME": "echoserver-ns1",
      "NODE_VERSION": "20.11.0",
      "YARN_VERSION": "1.22.19",
      "PORT": "80",
      "ECHOSERVER_SERVICE_HOST": "10.0.111.210",
      "ECHOSERVER_PORT": "tcp://10.0.111.210:80",
      "ECHOSERVER_PORT_80_TCP": "tcp://10.0.111.210:80",
      "KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST": "10.0.0.1",
      "KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT": "443",
      "KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS": "443",
      "ECHOSERVER_PORT_80_TCP_ADDR": "10.0.111.210",
      "KUBERNETES_PORT": "tcp://10.0.0.1:443",
      "ECHOSERVER_SERVICE_PORT": "80",
      "ECHOSERVER_PORT_80_TCP_PORT": "80",
      "KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_PORT": "443",
      "ECHOSERVER_PORT_80_TCP_PROTO": "tcp",
      "KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP": "tcp://10.0.0.1:443",
      "KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_PROTO": "tcp",
      "KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR": "10.0.0.1",
      "HOME": "/root"
    }
  }
  ```

- Curl from the test client pod to a URL that should be handled by the echo server in namespace `ns2`, via the Gateway:

  ```bash
  kubectl exec -it test-client -- curl http://10.0.20.19/ns2/subpath?query=demo | jq
  ```

- The output confirms that the request was handled by the echo server in namespace `ns2`:

  ```
  ...
      "HOSTNAME": "echoserver-ns2",
  ...
  ```

### Disable Gateway API support

To disable Gateway API support, first delete all the Gateway API resources that you have configured yourself.  In the example above, that would be the ReferenceGrants, the HTTPRoutes and the Gateway.  Then delete the `GatewayAPI` resource with name `default`:

```bash
kubectl delete -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: GatewayAPI
metadata:
  name: default
EOF
```

Please note that the Gateway API CRDs will be left in place.  This is to allow for the possibility of using other Gateway API implementations in addition to the one provided by $[prodname].

### Customize Gateway deployment and features

The `GatewayAPI` resource has fields that allow some aspects of Gateway deployments to be customized.  For example:
- `spec.gatewayDeployment.spec.template.metadata` allows arbitrary labels or annotations to be added to the pod that is created to implement each configured Gateway
- `spec.gatewayDeployment.spec.template.spec.nodeSelector` allows control over where Gateway implementation pods are scheduled
- `spec.gatewayDeployment.spec.template.spec.containers` allows control over the memory and CPU that Gateway implementation pods can use
- `spec.gatewayControllerDeployment.spec.template.spec.nodeSelector` allows control over where the gateway controller is scheduled.
- `spec.gatewayDeployment.service.metadata.annotations` allows control over annotations to place on the Service that is provisioned for each Gateway; these can be used, for example, to configure the cloud-specific type and properties of the associated external load balancer.
- `spec.gatewayDeployment.service.spec.*loadbalancer*` allows control over the corresponding `*loadbalancer*` fields in the Service that is provisioned for each Gateway; in some clouds these can also be used to configure the type and properties of the associated external load balancer.
- `spec.gatewayClasses` allows the provisioning of multiple GatewayClasses, each with its own set of customizations, instead of the single GatewayClass that the Tigera operator provisions by default.

For full details please see [the `GatewayAPI` reference documentation](../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.GatewayAPI).

To make use of these customization fields, use `kubectl edit gatewayapi default` to edit the YAML for the `GatewayAPI` resource, and add or modify the customization fields that you require.
