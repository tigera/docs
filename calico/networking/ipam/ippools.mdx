# Create multiple IP pools

## Understanding multiple IP pools

By default when you install {{prodname}}, a single IPv4 pool is created. This IP pool is used for allocating IP addresses to pods and, if needed,
tunnels within your cluster.

Sometimes you may want to configure additional IP pools. For example:

- If the IP address space available for pods in your cluster is disjointed.
- You want to [assign IP addresses based on cluster topology](assign-ip-addresses-topology.mdx).

## Create multiple IP pools when installing Calico

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Operator" value="Operator-0">

You can edit the Installation resource within `custom-resources.yaml` to include multiple unique IP pools. The following
example creates two IP pools assigned to different sets of nodes.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  ipPools:
  - name: pool-zone-1
    cidr: 192.168.0.0/24
    encapsulation: VXLAN
    nodeSelector: "zone == 'zone-1'"
  - name: pool-zone-2
    cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
    encapsulation: VXLAN
    nodeSelector: "zone == 'zone-2'"
```

After installing {{prodname}}, you can confirm the IP pools were created by using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get ippools
```

## Prevent the operator from managing IP pools

In some cases, you may want to disable IP pool management within the operator and instead use calicoctl or kubectl to
create and delete IP pools. To do this, you can edit the **Installation** resource with `custom-resources.yaml` to specify
an empty list of IP pools.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  ipPools: []
```

With this configuration, the operator will wait for you to create IP pools before installing {{prodname}} components.

<TabItem label="Manifest" value="Manifest-1">

When using manifests to install {{prodname}}, you can use calicoctl to manage multiple IP pools. For complete control, you can disable
creation of the default IP pool before doing so.

1. Disable the default IP pool by adding the following environment variable to the calico-node DaemonSet in `calico.yaml`.

   ```yaml
   env:
   - name: NO_DEFAULT_POOLS
      value: "true"
  ```

1. Then, install `calico.yaml`.

1. Create the desired IP pools. For example, the following commands create two IP pools assigned to different sets of nodes.

   ```bash
   calicoctl create -f -<<EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: IPPool
   metadata:
     name: pool-zone-1
   spec:
     cidr: 192.168.0.0/24
     vxlanMode: Always
     natOutgoing: true
     nodeSelector: zone == "zone-1"
   EOF
   ```

   ```bash
   calicoctl create -f -<<EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: IPPool
   metadata:
     name: pool-zone-2
   spec:
     cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
     vxlanMode: Always
     natOutgoing: true
     nodeSelector: zone == "zone-2"
   EOF
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
