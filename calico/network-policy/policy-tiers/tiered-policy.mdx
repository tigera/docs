# Get started with policy tiers

## Seamless network policy integration

**Network policy** is the primary tool for securing a Kubernetes network. It lets you restrict network traffic in your cluster so only the traffic that you want to flow is allowed. {{prodname}} provides more robust policy than Kubernetes, but you can use them together -- seamlessly. {{prodname}} supports:

- {{prodname}} network policy, (namespaced)
- {{prodname}} global network policy (non-namespaced, global)
- Kubernetes network policy

## Tiers: what and why?

**Tiers** are a hierarchical construct used to group policies and enforce higher precedence policies that cannot be circumvented by other teams. As you will learn in this tutorial, tiers have built-in features that support workload microsegmentation.

All {{prodname}} and Kubernetes network policies reside in tiers. You can start "thinking in tiers" by grouping your teams and types of policies within each group. For example, we recommend these three tiers (platform, security, and application).

Next, you can determine the priority of policies in tiers (from top to bottom). In the following example, the platform and security tiers use {{prodname}} global network policies that apply to all pods, while developer teams can safely manage pods within namespaces using Kubernetes network policy for their applications and microservices.

## Create a tier

The following is a sample YAML that creates a security tier and uses `kubectl` to apply it.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: Tier
metadata:
  name: security
spec:
  order: 300
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f security.yaml
```

## The default tier:

The default tier is created during installation and has the order of 1,000,000. This value is fixed, and cannot be changed. The desire is to evaluate policies in the default tier as last.

The default tier is where:

- You manage all Kubernetes network policies
- All network and global network policies without an explicit tier are placed.
- Network and global network policies are placed when you upgrade from Project Calico without tier support to {{prodname}} release with tier support.

## AdminNetworkPolicy tier:

The AdminNetworkPolicy tier is where all [Kubernetes admin network policies](https://network-policy-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/examples/) reside. It is automatically created during installation and has the order of 1,000. This value is fixed, and cannot be changed.

## Tier order

Tiers are sorted by their orders, starting from the lowest order (the highest priority) tiers.

## Policy processing

Policies are processed in sequential order from lowest order (highest priority) to highest order (lowest priority).

Two mechanisms drive how traffic is processed across tiered policies:

- Labels and selectors
- Policy action rules

It is important to understand the roles they play.

### Labels and selectors

Instead of IP addresses and IP ranges, network policies in Kubernetes depend on labels and selectors to determine which workloads can talk to each other. Workload identity is the same for Kubernetes and {{prodname}} network policies: as pods dynamically come and go, network policy is enforced based on the labels and selectors that you define.

The following diagrams show the relationship between all of the elements that affect traffic flow:

- **Tiers** group and order policies
- **Policy action rules** define how to process traffic in and across tiers, and policy labels and selectors specify how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints
- The **CNI**, **{{prodname}} components**, and underlying **dataplane** (iptables/eBPF) all make use of labels and selectors as part of routing traffic.

### Policy action rules

{{prodname}} network policy uses action rules to specify how to process traffic/packets:

- **Allow or Deny** - traffic is allowed or denied and the packet is handled accordingly. No further rules are processed.
- **Pass** - skips to the next tier that contains a policy that applies to the endpoint, and processes the packet. If the tier applies to the endpoint but no action is taken on the packet, the packet is dropped.
- **Log** - creates a log, and evaluation continues processing to the next rule

### Implicit default deny

As shown in the following diagram, at the end of each tier is an implicit default deny. This is a safeguard that helps mitigate against unsecured policy.
Because of this safeguard, you must either explicitly update tier's default action to **Pass** or apply a Pass action rule when you want traffic evaluation to continue.
In the following example, the Pass action in a policy ensures that traffic evaluation continues, and overrides the implicit default deny.

![implicit-deny](/img/calico-enterprise/implicit-deny.svg)

Letâ€™s look at a Dev/Ops global network policy in a high precedence tier (Platform). The policy denies ingress and egress traffic to workloads that match selector, `env == "stage"`. To ensure that policies continue to evaluate traffic after this policy, the policy adds a Pass action for both ingress and egress.

**Pass action rule example**

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: devops.stage-env
spec:
  tier: devops
  order: 255
  selector: env == "stage"
  ingress:
    - action: Deny
      source:
        selector: env != "stage"
    - action: Pass
  egress:
    - action: Deny
      destination:
        selector: env != "stage"
    - action: Pass
  types:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
```

The other option, is to update tier's default action to **Pass** to override the implicit default deny.

**Pass default action tier example**

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: Tier
metadata:
  name: devops
spec:
  order: 300
  defautlAction: Pass
```

### Policy endpoint matching across tiers

Whoever is responsible for tier creation, also needs to understand how policy selects matching endpoints across tiers. For normal policy processing (without apply-on-forward, pre-DNAT, and do-not-track), if no policies within a tier apply to endpoints, the tier is skipped, and the tier's implicit deny behavior is not executed.

In the following example, **policy D** in the Security tier includes a Pass action rule because we want traffic evaluation to continue to the next tier in sequence. In the Platform tier, there are no selectors in policies that match endpoints so the tier is skipped, including the end of tier deny. Evaluation continues to the Application tier. **Policy J** is the first policy with a matching endpoint.

### Default endpoint behavior

Also, tier managers need to understand the default behavior for endpoints based on whether the endpoint is known or unknown, and the endpoint type. As shown in the following table:

- **Known endpoints** - {{prodname}} resources that are managed by Felix
- **Unknown endpoints** - interfaces/resources not recognizable as part of our data model

| Endpoint type          | Default behavior for known endpoints                                    | Default behavior for unknown endpoints (outside of our data model) |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Workload, {{prodname}} | Deny                                                                    | Deny                                                               |
| Workload, Kubernetes   | Allow ingress from same Kubernetes namespace; allow all egress          | Deny                                                               |
| Host                   | Deny. With exception of auto host endpoints, which get `default-allow`. | Fall through and use iptables rules                                 |

## Best practices for tiered policy

To control and authorize access to {{prodname}} tiers, policies, and Kubernetes network policies, you use Kubernetes RBAC. Security teams can prevent unauthorized viewing or modification of higher precedence (lower order) tiers, while still allowing developers or service owners to manage the detailed policies related to their workloads.

We recommend:

- Limit tier creation permissions to Admin users only; creating and reordering tiers affects your policy processing workflow

- Limit full CRUD operations on tiers and policy management to select Admin users

- Review your policy processing whenever you add/reorder tiers

  For example, you may need to update Pass action rules to policies before or after the new tier. Intervening tiers may require changes to policies before and after, depending on the endpoints.
