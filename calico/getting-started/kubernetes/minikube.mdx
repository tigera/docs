# Quickstart for Calico on minikube

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Big picture

This quickstart gets you a single-node minikube cluster with {{prodname}}
in approximately 1 minute. You can use this cluster for testing and
development.

## Value

Use this quickstart to quickly and easily try {{prodname}} features.

## Before you begin

- Install, but do not start, minikube. [How to install minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/#what-youll-need)
- Install kubectl.[How to install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- Install a minikube driver. For example Docker. A full List of available drivers can be [found here.](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/)

## How to

### Create a single-node minikube cluster

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Built-in {{prodname}}" value="Built-in {{prodname}}-0">

Minikube offers a built-in {{prodname}} implementation, this is a quick way to checkout {{prodname}} features.

:::note

Enabling preinstalled {{prodname}} might be the quickest way for testing. However, if you like to checkout a more recent version or features of {{prodname}} you should consider using Manifest or Operator approach.

:::

```batch
minikube start --network-plugin=cni --cni=calico
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Operator" value="Operator-1">

Start your minikube cluster with one master node using the following command.

:::note

If `192.168.0.0/16` is already in use within your network you must select a different pod network CIDR, by replacing `192.168.0.0/16` in the following command.

:::

```batch
minikube start --network-plugin=cni --extra-config=kubeadm.pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
```

Install the Tigera {{prodname}} operator and custom resource definitions.

```batch
kubectl create -f {{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
```

:::note

Due to the large size of the CRD bundle, `kubectl apply` might exceed request limits. Instead, use `kubectl create` or `kubectl replace`.

:::

Install {{prodname}} by creating the necessary custom resource. For more information on configuration options available in this manifest, see [the installation reference](../../reference/installation/api.mdx).

:::note

Before creating this manifest, read its contents and make sure its settings are correct for your environment. For example,
if you have replaced `pod-network-cidr` you must change it in this file as well.

:::

```batch
kubectl create -f {{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Manifest" value="Manifest-2">

Start your minikube cluster with one master node using the following command.

```batch
minikube start --network-plugin=cni
```

Install {{prodname}}.

```batch
kubectl apply -f {{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/calico.yaml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify {{prodname}} installation

You can verify {{prodname}} installation in your cluster by issuing the following command.

```batch
watch kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=calico-node -A
```

You should see a result similar to the below. Note that the namespace might be different, depending on the method you followed.

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   calico-node-mlqvs   1/1     Running   0          5m18s
```

Use `ctrl+c` to break out of watch.

Congratulations you now have a minikube cluster equipped with {{prodname}}

### Add an additional worker node

:::note

This as an optional step, you can safely skip this step if you do not require an additional worker node.

:::

```batch
minikube node add
```

Verify nodes using the following command

```batch
kubectl get nodes
```

### Clean up

Issuing a delete command will destroy the cluster that you created in this tutorial.

```batch
minikube delete
```
