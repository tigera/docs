# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

## Big picture

Enable {{prodname}} in EKS managed Kubernetes service.

## Value

EKS has built-in support for {{prodname}}, providing a robust implementation of the full Kubernetes Network Policy API. EKS users wanting to go beyond Kubernetes network policy capabilities can make full use of the Calico Network Policy API.

You can also use {{prodname}} for networking on EKS in place of the default AWS VPC networking without the need to use IP addresses from the underlying VPC. This allows you to take advantage of the full set of {{prodname}} networking features, including {{prodname}}'s flexible IP address management capabilities.

## Before you begin...

:::note

{{prodname}} makes use of the Kubernetes Container Storage Interface (CSI) to support various types of volumes. The necessary drivers required for CSI
to function correctly in EKS clusters will no longer be present by default in clusters running Kubernetes 1.23. Please see the following link to ensure your cluster
is configured correctly based on the version of Kubernetes being used in your cluster: [AWS EBS CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html)

## How to

### Install EKS with Amazon VPC networking

The geeky details of what you get:

<GeekDetails
  prodname='{{prodname}}'
  details='Policy:Calico,IPAM:AWS,CNI:AWS,Overlay:No,Routing:VPC Native,Datastore:Kubernetes'
/>

To enable {{prodname}} network policy enforcement on an EKS cluster using the AWS VPC CNI plugin, follow these step-by-step instructions: [Installing Calico on Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.html)

### Install EKS with {{prodname}} networking

The geeky details of what you get:

<GeekDetails
  prodname='{{prodname}}'
  details='Policy:Calico,IPAM:Calico,CNI:Calico,Overlay:VXLAN,Routing:Calico,Datastore:Kubernetes'
/>

:::note

{{prodname}} networking cannot currently be installed on the EKS control plane nodes. As a result the control plane nodes
will not be able to initiate network connections to {{prodname}} pods. (This is a general limitation of EKS's custom networking support,
not specific to {{prodname}}.) As a workaround, trusted pods that require control plane nodes to connect to them, such as those implementing
admission controller webhooks, can include `hostNetwork:true` in their pod spec. See the Kubernetes API
[pod spec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.21/#podspec-v1-core)
definition for more information on this setting.

:::

For these instructions, we will use `eksctl` to provision the cluster. However, you can use any of the methods in [Getting Started with Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)

Before you get started, make sure you have downloaded and configured the [necessary prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html#eksctl-prereqs)

1. First, create an Amazon EKS cluster without any nodes.

   ```batch
   eksctl create cluster --name my-calico-cluster --without-nodegroup
   ```

1. Since this cluster will use {{prodname}} for networking, you must delete the `aws-node` daemon set to disable AWS VPC networking for pods.

   ```batch
   kubectl delete daemonset -n kube-system aws-node
   ```

1. Now that you have a cluster configured, you can install {{prodname}}.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Operator" value="Operator-0">

1. Install the operator.

   ```batch
   kubectl create -f {{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
   ```

1. Configure the {{prodname}} installation.

   ```batch
   kubectl create -f - <<EOF
   kind: Installation
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: default
   spec:
     kubernetesProvider: EKS
     cni:
       type: Calico
     calicoNetwork:
       bgp: Disabled
   EOF
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Manifest" value="Manifest-1">

1. Install the {{prodname}} manifest.

   ```batch
   kubectl apply -f {{manifestsUrl}}/manifests/calico-vxlan.yaml
   ```

1. Configure {{prodname}} to disable AWS src/dst checks.

   ```batch
   kubectl -n kube-system set env daemonset/calico-node FELIX_AWSSRCDSTCHECK=Disable
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

1. Finally, add nodes to the cluster.

   ```batch
   eksctl create nodegroup --cluster my-calico-cluster --node-type t3.medium --max-pods-per-node 100
   ```

   :::tip

   Without the `--max-pods-per-node` option above, EKS will limit the [number of pods based on node-type](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/eni-max-pods.txt). See `eksctl create nodegroup --help` for the full set of node group options.
