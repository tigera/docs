# Quickstart for Calico on MicroK8s

## Big picture

Install a single node MicroK8s cluster with {{prodname}} in approximately 5 minutes.

## Value

MicroK8s is a lightweight upstream Kubernetes distribution package to run as an immutable container.

Use this quickstart to quickly and easily try {{prodname}} features with MicroK8s.

## Before you begin

- Make sure you have a linux host that meets the following requirements:
  - 4GB RAM
  - 20GB free disk space
  - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS or 16.04 LTS (or another operating system that supports `snapd`)

## How to

1. Initialize the node using the following command.

   ```
   snap install microk8s --classic
   ```

   :::note

   You can check out other versions of Kubernetes MicroK8s implementation published in snap using `snap info microk8s` command.

   :::

1. Enable dns services.

   ```
   microk8s enable dns
   ```

1. Check your cluster status

   ```
   microk8s kubectl get pods -A
   ```

   You should see a result similar to

   ```
   NAMESPACE     NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   kube-system   calico-node-b82zp                          1/1     Running   0          64s
   kube-system   calico-kube-controllers-555fc8cc5c-b7cp6   1/1     Running   0          64s
   kube-system   coredns-588fd544bf-mbc7n                   1/1     Running   0          39s
   ```

The geeky details of what you get:

  prodname='{{prodname}}'
  details='Policy:Calico,IPAM:Calico,CNI:Calico,Overlay:VXLAN,Routing:Calico,Datastore:Kubernetes'
