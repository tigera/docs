# Calico quickstart guide

This quickstart guide shows you how to install Calico, secure a cluster with network policy, and monitor network traffic with Calico Whisker.

## Before you begin

You'll need to install a few tools to complete this tutorial:

* `kind`.
  This is what you'll use to create a cluster on your workstation.
  For installation instructions, see the [`kind` documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).
* Docker Engine or Docker Desktop.
  This is required to run containers for the `kind` utility.
  For installation instructions, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
* `kubectl`.
  This is the tool you'll use to interact with your cluster.
  For installation instructions, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)


## Step 1: Create a cluster

In this step, you will:
* **Create a cluster:** Use `kind` to create a Kubernetes cluster.
* **Verify the cluster:** Check that the cluster is running and ready.

1. Create a file called `config.yaml` and give it the following content:

   ```bash
   kind: Cluster
   apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
   nodes:
     - role: control-plane
     - role: worker
     - role: worker
   networking:
     disableDefaultCNI: true
     podSubnet: 192.168.0.0/16
   ```

   This configuration file tells `kind` to create a cluster with one control-plane node and two worker nodes.
   It instructs `kind` to create the cluster without a CNI.
   The `podSubnet` range defines the IP addresses that Kubernetes will use for pods.

2. Start your Kubernetes cluster with the configuration file by running the following command:

   ```bash
   kind create cluster --name=calico-cluster --config=config.yaml
   ```

   `kind` reads your configuration file and creates a cluster in a few minutes.

   ```bash title='Expected output'
   Creating cluster "calico-cluster" ...
   ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.29.2) üñº
   ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶ üì¶ üì¶

   ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è
   ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ
   ‚úì Joining worker nodes üöú
   Set kubectl context to "kind-calico-cluster"
   You can now use your cluster with:

   kubectl cluster-info --context kind-calico-cluster

   Thanks for using kind! üòä
   ```

3. To verify that your cluster is working, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   You should see three nodes with the name you gave the cluster.

   ```bash title="Expected output"
   NAME                           STATUS     ROLES           AGE     VERSION
   calico-cluster-control-plane   NotReady   control-plane   5m46s   v1.29.2
   calico-cluster-worker          NotReady   <none>          5m23s   v1.29.2
   calico-cluster-worker2         NotReady   <none>          5m22s   v1.29.2
   ```

   Don't wait for the nodes to get a `Ready` status.
   They remain in a `NotReady` status until you configure networking in the next step.

## Step 2. Install Calico

In this step, you will install Calico in your cluster.

1. Install the Tigera operator and custom resource definitions.

   ```bash
   kubectl create -f $[manifestsUrl]/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
   ```

   ```bash title="Expected output"
   namespace/tigera-operator created
   serviceaccount/tigera-operator created
   clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/tigera-operator-secrets created
   clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/tigera-operator created
   clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/tigera-operator created
   rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/tigera-operator-secrets created
   deployment.apps/tigera-operator created
   ```

2. Install $[prodname] by creating the necessary custom resources.

   ```bash
   kubectl create -f $[manifestsUrl]/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
   ```

   ```bash title="Expected output"
   installation.operator.tigera.io/default created
   apiserver.operator.tigera.io/default created
   goldmane.operator.tigera.io/default created
   whisker.operator.tigera.io/default created
   ```

3. Monitor the deployment by running the following command:

   ```bash
   watch kubectl get tigerastatus
   ```

   After a few minutes, all the Calico components display `True` in the `AVAILABLE` column.

   ```bash title="Expected output"
   NAME                            AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE
   apiserver                       True        False         False      4m9s
   calico                          True        False         False      3m29s
   goldmane                        True        False         False      3m39s
   ippools                         True        False         False      6m4s
   whisker                         True        False         False      3m19s
   ```

## Step 3. Monitor network traffic in Calico Whisker

The Whisker web console deploys automatically, but it is not accessible from outside the cluster by default.
To view the web console, you need to allow access.

In this step, you will:

* **Set up port forwarding:** This allows you to access the Whisker web console from your browser.
* **Open the Whisker web console:** View the network traffic logs in real time.

1. From your terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward -n calico-system service/whisker 8081:8081
   ```

   ```bash title="Expected output"
   Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8081 -> 8081
   Forwarding from [::1]:8081 -> 8081
   ```

   Keep this terminal open throughout the rest of this tutorial.
   The Whisker web console needs the port forwarding to be active to receive logs.

2. To open Calico Whisker, open your browser and go to `localhost:8081`.
   You won't see any flows at the beginning.
   But in a few moments, as the console receives flow logs, you'll begin to see a list of connections.

   <Screenshot src="/img/whisker.jpg" alt="Whisker" />
   *Figure {figCount++}: Whisker web console with allowed flows for core Kubernetes services.*

   The web console accumulates flow logs in real time.
   Keep this window open through the rest of the tutorial to see logs of the connections your pods are making.

## Step 4. Deploy NGINX and BusyBox to generate traffic

Now it's time to generate some network traffic.
We'll do this first by deploying an NGINX server and exposing it as a service in the cluster.
Then we'll make HTTP requests from another pod in the cluster to the NGINX server and to an external website.
For this we'll use the BusyBox utility.

In this step, you will:
* **Create a server:** Deploy an NGINX web server in your Kubernetes cluster.
* **Expose the server:** Make the NGINX server accessible within the cluster.
* **Test connectivity:** Use a BusyBox pod to verify connections to the NGINX server and the public internet.

1. Create a namespace for your application:

   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace quickstart
   ```
   ```bash title="Expected output"
   namespace/quickstart created
   ```

1. Deploy an NGINX web server in the `quickstart` namespace:

   ```bash
   kubectl create deployment --namespace=quickstart nginx --image=nginx
   ```
   ```bash title="Expected output"
   deployment.apps/nginx created
   ```

1. Expose the NGINX deployment to make it accessible within the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl expose --namespace=quickstart deployment nginx --port=80
   ```
   ```bash title="Expected output"
   service/nginx exposed
   ```

1. Start a BusyBox session to test whether you can access the NGINX server.

    ```bash
    kubectl run --namespace=quickstart access --rm -ti --image busybox /bin/sh
    ```

    This command creates a BusyBox pod inside the `quickstart` namespace and starts a shell session inside the pod.

    ```bash title="Expected output"
    If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
    / #
    ```

1. In the BusyBox shell, run the following command to test communication with the NGINX server:

   ```bash
   wget -qO- http://nginx
   ```

   You should see the HTML content of the NGINX welcome page.

   ```html title="Expected output"
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
   <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
   <style>
   html { color-scheme: light dark; }
   body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto;
   font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }
   </style>
   </head>
   <body>
   <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
   <p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
   working. Further configuration is required.</p>

   <p>For online documentation and support please refer to
   <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
   Commercial support is available at
   <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>

   <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   This confirms that the BusyBox pod can access the NGINX server.

1. In the Busybox shell, run the following command test communication with the public internet:

    ```bash
    wget -qO- https://docs.tigera.io/pod-connection-test.txt
    ```

    You should see the content of the file `pod-connectivity-test.txt`.

    ```html title="Expected output"
    You successfully connected to https://docs.tigera.io/pod-connection-test.txt.
    ```

    This confirms that the BusyBox pod can access the public internet.


1. Return to your browser to see the connection appear in the Whisker web console.
   You should see three new connection types: one to `coredns` one to `nginx`, and another to `PUBLIC NETWORK`.

   <Screenshot src="/img/quickstart-whisker2.png" alt="whisker2" />

## Step 5. Restrict all traffic with a default deny policy

To effectively secure your cluster, it's best to start by denying all traffic, and then gradually allowing only the necessary traffic.
We'll do this by applying a Global Calico Network Policy that denies all ingress and egress traffic by default.

In this step, you will:
* **Implement a global default deny policy:** Use a Global Calico Network Policy to deny all ingress and egress traffic by default.
* **Verify access is denied:** Use your BusyBox pod to confirm that the policy is working as expected.

1. Create a Global Calico Network Policy to deny all traffic except for the necessary system namespaces:

   ```bash
   kubectl create -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: default-deny
   spec:
     selector: projectcalico.org/namespace not in {'kube-system', 'calico-system', 'calico-apiserver'}
     types:
       - Ingress
       - Egress
   EOF
   ```
   ```bash title="Expected output"
   globalnetworkpolicy.projectcalico.org/default-deny created
   ```

1. Now go back to your BusyBox shell and test access to the NGINX server again:

   ```bash
   wget -qO- http://nginx
   ```

   You should see the following output, indicating that access is denied:

   ```bash title="Expected output"
   wget: bad address 'nginx'
   ```

1. Test access to the public internet again:

   ```bash
   wget -qO- https://docs.tigera.io/pod-connection-test.txt
   ```

   You should see the following output, indicating that egress traffic is also denied:

   ```bash title="Expected output"
   wget: bad address 'docs.tigera.io'
   ```

1. Return to your browser to see the denied flow logs appear in the Whisker web console.
   You should see two denied flows to `coredns`.

   <Screenshot src="/img/quickstart-whisker3.png" alt="whisker3" />
   *Figure {figCount++}: Whisker web console showing denied flows to NGINX server and `https://docs.tigera.io`.*


   By following these steps, you have successfully implemented a global default deny policy and verified that it is working as expected.

## Step 6. Create targeted network policy for allowed traffic

Now that you have a default deny policy in place, you need to create specific policies to allow only the necessary traffic for your applications to function.
The `default-deny` policy blocks all ingress and egress traffic for pods not in system namespaces, including our `access` (BusyBox) and `nginx` pods in the `quickstart` namespace.

In this step, you will:
* **Allow egress traffic from BusyBox** Create a network policy to allow egress traffic from the BusyBox pod to the public internet.
* **Allow ingress traffic to NGINX** Create a network policy to allow ingress traffic to the NGINX server.

1.  Create a Calico network policy in the `quickstart` namespace that selects the `access` pod and allows all egress traffic from it.

    ```bash
    kubectl create -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: allow-busybox-egress
      namespace: quickstart
    spec:
      selector: run == 'access'
      types:
      - Egress
      egress:
      - action: Allow
    EOF
    ```

    ```bash title="Expected output"
    networkpolicy.projectcalico.org/allow-busybox-egress created
    ```

1.  Back in the BusyBox shell, test access to the public internet again.
    Because egress traffic is now allowed from this pod, this should succeed:

    ```bash
    wget -qO- https://docs.tigera.io/pod-connection-test.txt
    ```

    ```html title="Expected output"
    You successfully connected to https://docs.tigera.io/pod-connection-test.txt.
    ```

1. Test access to the NGINX server again.
   Egress *from* the `access` pod is allowed by the new policy, but ingress *to* the `nginx` pod is still blocked by the `default-deny` policy.
   This request should fail.

   ```bash
   wget -qO- http://nginx
   ```

   ```bash title="Expected output"
   wget: bad address 'nginx'
   ```


{/*    *Figure {figCount++}: Whisker showing allowed egress from BusyBox to public internet, but denied connection to NGINX.* */}

4.  Create another Calico network policy in the `quickstart` namespace.
    This policy selects the `nginx` pods (using the label `app=nginx`) and allows ingress traffic specifically *from* pods with the label `run=access`.

    ```bash
    kubectl create -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: allow-nginx-ingress
      namespace: quickstart
    spec:
      selector: app == 'nginx'
      types:
      - Ingress
      ingress:
      - action: Allow
        source:
          selector: run == 'access'
    EOF
    ```

    ```bash title="Expected output"
    networkpolicy.org/allow-nginx-ingress created
    ```

1.  Test access to the NGINX server again.
    From the BusyBox shell, test access to the NGINX server one more time:

    ```bash
    wget -qO- http://nginx
    ```

    Now that both egress from `access` *and* ingress to `nginx` (from `access`) are allowed, the connection should succeed. You'll see the NGINX welcome page:

    ```html title="Expected output"
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
    <style>
    html { color-scheme: light dark; }
    body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto;
    font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
    <p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
    working. Further configuration is required.</p>

    <p>For online documentation and support please refer to
    <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
    Commercial support is available at
    <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

You have now successfully implemented a default deny policy and then created targeted allow policies to restore connectivity only for your applications.

## Step 7. Clean up

* To remove the `kind` cluster, run the following command:

  ```bash
  kind delete cluster --name calico-cluster
  ```

  ```bash title="Expected output"
  Deleting cluster "calico-cluster" ...
  Deleted nodes: ["calico-cluster-control-plane" "calico-cluster-worker2" "calico-cluster-worker"]
  ```

## Additional resources

* TBD
