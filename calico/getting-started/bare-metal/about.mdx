# About non-cluster hosts

## Big picture

Secure non-cluster hosts by installing {{prodname}} for networking and/or networking policy.

## Value

Not all hosts in your environment run pods/workloads. You may have physical machines or legacy applications that you cannot move into a Kubernetes cluster, but still need to securely communicate with pods in your cluster. {{prodname}} lets you enforce policy on these **non-cluster hosts** using the same robust {{prodname}} network policy that you use for pods.

## Concepts

### Non-cluster hosts and host endpoints

A **non-cluster host** is a computer that is running an application that is _not part of a Kubernetes cluster_. Using {{prodname}} network policy, you can secure these host interfaces using **host endpoints**. Host endpoints can have labels, and work the same as labels on pods/workload endpoints.

The advantage is, you can write network policy rules to apply to both workload endpoints and host endpoints using label selectors; where each selector can refer to the either type (or be a mix of the two). For example, you can write a cluster-wide policy for non-cluster hosts that is immediately applied to every host. To learn how to restrict traffic to/from hosts using {{prodname}} network policy see, [Protect hosts](../../network-policy/hosts/protect-hosts.mdx).

If you are using the etcd3 database, you can also install {{prodname}} with networking as described below.

## Before you begin

**Supported**

- All platforms in this release, except Windows

**Required**

- Non-cluster host meets [system requirements](requirements.mdx) for {{prodname}}. If you want to use a package manager for installation, the non-cluster host must be a system derived from Ubuntu or RedHat.
- Set up a datastore; if {{prodname}} is installed on a cluster, you already have a datastore
- Install `kubectl` or [`calicoctl`](../../operations/calicoctl/index.mdx). (`kubectl` works only with the Kubernetes datastore.)

## Next steps

Select an install method.

:::note

{{prodname}} must be installed on each non-cluster host that you want to control with networking and/or policy.
