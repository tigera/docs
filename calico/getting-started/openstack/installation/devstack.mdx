# DevStack

The networking-calico project provides a DevStack plugin. The following
instructions explain how to set up a single or multiple node DevStack/{{prodname}}
system, and then how to see {{prodname}} connectivity in action.

:::note

networking-calico includes a
[shell script](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/networking-calico/devstack/bootstrap.sh)
that implements the following setup instructions. You are welcome to use it,
but we recommend that you read the following description first anyway, and
briefly review the script's code, so that you will understand what the
script does.

:::

## Single (or first) node setup

To prepare a single node DevStack/{{prodname}} system, that is with all controller
and compute functions running on the same node:

1. Download DevStack as usual.

2. Add to your DevStack local.conf file:

   ```bash
   enable_plugin networking-calico https://github.com/projectcalico/networking-calico
   ```

3. Run `stack.sh`.

4. Create a shared, routed network with an IPv4 subnet:

   ```bash
   . openrc admin admin
   neutron net-create --shared --provider:network_type local calico
   neutron subnet-create --gateway 10.65.0.1 --enable-dhcp --ip-version 4 --name calico-v4 calico 10.65.0/24
   ```

5. Ensure that IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding are enabled:

   ```bash
   sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
   ```

## Multi-node setup

This plugin also supports additional compute-only nodes. So, in the system as
a whole, there can then be:

- one node with both controller and compute function

- any number of additional nodes with just compute function.

The first node should be prepared as described above. Then, for each
additional compute node:

- set and export the SERVICE_HOST environment variable, to the name of the
  controller node; for example:

  ```bash
  export SERVICE_HOST=calico-vm18
  ```

- follow the steps above, except for the network and subnet creations, to
  install and set up DevStack with {{prodname}} on that node.

## Demonstrating {{prodname}} connectivity

Then, to see {{prodname}} connectivity in action:

1. Launch instances attached to the 'calico' network.

2. Use `ip route` to observe per-instance routes created by the {{prodname}} agent.

3. Log into each instance (e.g. through Horizon console) and verify that it can
   ping the others.
