# Calico on OpenStack

There are many ways to try out {{prodname}} with OpenStack. We provide instructions for the
following methods:

- [Package-based install for Ubuntu](ubuntu.mdx)

- [RPM-based install for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](redhat.mdx)

- [DevStack](devstack.mdx) (for development purposes onlyâ€”not recommended for production!)

In all cases, except DevStack, you will need at least two or three servers to
get going: one OpenStack controller and one or more OpenStack compute nodes.
