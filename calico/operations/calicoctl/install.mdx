## Big picture

This guide helps you install the `calicoctl` command line tool to manage $[prodname] resources
and perform administrative functions.

## Value

The `calicoctl` command line tool is required to use many of $[prodname]'s features. It
is used to manage $[prodname] policies and configuration, as well as view detailed cluster status.

## Concepts

### API groups

All Kubernetes resources belong to an API group. The API group is indicated by the resource's `apiVersion`. For example, $[prodname]
uses resources in the `projectcalico.org/v3` API group for configuration, and the operator uses resources in the `operator.tigera.io/v1` API group.

You can read more about API groups in [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-groups).

### calicoctl and kubectl

To manage $[prodname] APIs in the `projectcalico.org/v3` API group, you should use `calicoctl`. This is because
`calicoctl` provides important validation and defaulting for these resources that is not available in `kubectl`. However, `kubectl`
should still be used to manage other Kubernetes resources.

:::note

If you would like to use `kubectl` to manage `projectcalico.org/v3` API resources, you can use the
[Calico API server](../install-apiserver.mdx).

:::

:::caution

Never modify resources in the `crd.projectcalico.org` API group directly. These are internal data representations
and modifying them directly may result in unexpected behavior.
In addition to resource management, `calicoctl` also enables other $[prodname] administrative tasks such as viewing IP pool utilization
and BGP status.

:::

### Datastore

$[prodname] objects are stored in one of two datastores, either etcd or Kubernetes. The choice of datastore is determined at the time $[prodname]
is installed. Typically for Kubernetes installations the Kubernetes datastore is the default.

You can run `calicoctl` on any host with network access to the $[prodname] datastore as either a binary or a container.
For step-by-step instructions, refer to the section that corresponds to your desired deployment.

<!--- Change download URL to latest release if user browsing master branch.  --->

<!--- For master, we hard-code a version since we don't host master releases of calicoctl.  --->

## How to

:::note

Make sure you always install the version of `calicoctl` that matches the version of $[prodname] running on your cluster.

1. Log into the host, open a terminal prompt, and navigate to the location where
   you want to install the binary.

   :::tip

   Consider navigating to a location that's in your `PATH`. For example,
   `/usr/local/bin/`.

   :::

1. Use the following command to download the `calicoctl` binary.

   <CodeBlock>curl -L {url}/calicoctl-linux-amd64 -o calicoctl</CodeBlock>

1. Set the file to be executable.

   ```bash
   chmod +x ./calicoctl
   ```

   :::note

   If the location of `calicoctl` is not already in your `PATH`, move the file
   to one that is or add its location to your `PATH`. This will allow you to invoke it
   without having to prepend its location.

Verify the plugin works.

```
kubectl calico -h

You can now run any `calicoctl` subcommands through `kubectl calico`.

:::note

If you run these commands from your local machine (instead of a host node), some of
the node related subcommands will not work (like node status).

### Install calicoctl as a container on a single host

To install `calicoctl` as a container on a single host, log into the
target host and issue the following command.

```bash
docker pull $[registry]{{imageNames.calicoctl}}:$[releaseTitle]
```

**Next step**:

[Configure `calicoctl` to connect to your datastore](configure/index.mdx).
