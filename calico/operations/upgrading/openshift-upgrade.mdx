# Upgrade Calico on OpenShift 4

## About upgrading {{prodname}}

This page describes how to upgrade to {{version}} for OpenShift 4 from an existing {{prodname}} cluster.

## Upgrade OwnerReferences

If you do not use OwnerReferences on resources in the projectcalico.org/v3 API group, you can skip this section.

Starting in Calico v3.28, a change in the way UIDs are generated for projectcalico.org/v3 resources requires that you update any OwnerReferences
that refer to projectcalico.org/v3 resources as an owner. After upgrade, the UID for all projectcalico.org/v3 resources will be changed, resulting in any
owned resources being garbage collected by Kubernetes.

1. Remove any OwnerReferences from resources in your cluster that have `apiGroup: projectcalico.org/v3`.
1. Perform the upgrade normally.
1. Add new OwnerReferences to your resources referencing the new UID.

## Upgrading Calico on OpenShift 4

Make a manifests directory.

```bash
mkdir manifests
```

<InstallOpenShiftManifests install_type='upgrade' />

Apply the updated manifests.

```bash
oc apply -f manifests/
```

You can now monitor the upgrade progress with the following command:

```bash
watch oc get tigerastatus
```

If you were upgrading from a version of Calico prior to v3.14 and followed the pre-upgrade steps for host endpoints above, review traffic logs from the temporary policy,
add any global network policies needed to allow traffic, and delete the temporary network policy **allow-all-upgrade**.
