description: Install Calico in eBPF mode with auto configuration.

# Auto configuration

## Before you begin
- Learn more [about eBPF] (../ebpf/overview.mdx): Concepts, Supported platforms, Performance, etc.

## Requirements

Your cluster must meet the following requirements to proceed with the auto-configuration process:
- Install $[prodname] with the Operator.
- Your cluster has <code>kube-proxy</code> running in the <code>kube-system</code> namespace.
- <code>kube-proxy</code> is <strong>not</strong> managed by an automated tool, such as Helm or ArgoCD.
- The Operator can access <code>kubernetes</code> service and endpoints.

## How to

The steps below outline how to install $[prodname] directly in eBPF mode:

- [Create a cluster](#create-a-suitable-cluster) suitable to run $[prodname] **with the added requirement that the nodes must use a recent
  enough kernel**.
- [Install the Tigera Operator](#install-the-tigera-operator) (possibly via a Helm chart), and the associated Custom Resource Definitions.
- **[Download and tweak the installation Custom Resource](#tweak-and-apply-installation-custom-resources) to tell the operator to use eBPF mode.**
- [Apply a set of Custom Resources](#tweak-and-apply-installation-custom-resources) to tell the operator what to install.
- [Wait for the operator to provision all the associated resources and report back via its status resource](#monitor-the-progress-of-the-installation).

### Create a suitable cluster

The basic requirement for eBPF mode is to have a recent-enough kernel (see [Overview page] (../ebpf/overview.mdx#supported)).

At this time, we recommend `kubeadm`-provisioned clusters for **auto-configuration**, which are supported as long as the chosen base OS (such as Ubuntu 20.04) meets the kernel requirements.

### Install the Tigera Operator

Install the Tigera Operator without applying the `custom-resources.yaml` - you will update this file in a later step in this doc. 

```bash
 kubectl create -f $[manifestsUrl]/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
```

### Tweak and apply installation Custom Resources

When the main install guide tells you to apply the `custom-resources.yaml`, typically by running `kubectl create` with
the URL of the file directly, you should instead download the file, so that you can edit it:

```bash
 curl -o custom-resources.yaml $[manifestsUrl]/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
```

Edit the file in your editor of choice and find the `Installation` resource, which should be at the top of the file.
To enable eBPF mode, we need to add a new `calicoNetwork` section inside the `spec` of the Installation resource,
including the `linuxDataplane`, `bpfNetworkBootstrap`, and `kubeProxyManagement` fields. For EKS Bottlerocket OS only, you should also add the `flexVolumePath` setting
as shown below.

For example:

```yaml
# This section includes base $[prodname] installation configuration.

apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
   # Added calicoNetwork section with linuxDataplane field
  calicoNetwork:
    linuxDataplane: BPF
    bpfNetworkBootstrap: Enabled
    kubeProxyManagement: Enabled

   # EKS with Bottlerocket as node image only:
   # flexVolumePath: /var/lib/kubelet/plugins

   # Install Calico Open Source
   variant: Calico

# This section configures the Calico API server.

apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: APIServer 
metadata: 
  name: default 
spec: {}
```

Then apply the edited file:

```bash
kubectl create -f custom-resources.yaml
```

:::note

If you are running kube-proxy in IPVS mode, switch to iptables mode before creating the Custom Resources.

:::

:::tip

If you already created the custom resources, you can switch your cluster over to eBPF mode by updating the
installation resource. The operator will automatically roll out the change.

```bash
kubectl patch installation.operator.tigera.io default --type merge -p '{"spec":{"calicoNetwork":{"linuxDataplane":"BPF", "bpfNetworkBootstrap":"Enabled", "kubeProxyManagement":"Enabled", "hostPorts":null}}}'
```

:::

### Monitor the progress of the installation

You can monitor progress of the installation with the following command:

```bash
watch kubectl get tigerastatus
```
