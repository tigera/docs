### What's new {#whats-new-v0.1.0}

#### Support for Azure CNI with overlay networking

We've added supports for Azure CNI with overlay networking. This options augments support for traditional Azure CNI where a VNET IP address is assigned to every pod, which can lead to IP address exhaustion. To review both options, see [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../getting-started/kubernetes/managed-public-cloud/aks).
