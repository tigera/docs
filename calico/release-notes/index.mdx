# Calico Open Source 3.27 release notes

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of {{prodname}}.

## New features and enhancements

### HPC-based Windows install and upgrade

We've added support for HPC (HostProcess/Privileged containers) install and upgrade for Windows nodes/
{{prodname}} can now bootstrap Windows worker nodes just like Linux worker nodes.
Platform engineers can scale Windows worker nodes with an auto-scaling node pool without bootstraping each node manually, and upgrade {{prodname}} deployments without manually upgrading nodes one at a time.

For more information, see [Quickstart](../getting-started/kubernetes/windows-calico/quickstart#install-calico-for-windows-using-hostprocess-containers).

### ipV6 support for eBPF

eBPF now supports ipv6, which offers advanced and better features compared with ipv4.

For eBPF details, see [Enable the eBPF dataplane](../operations/ebpf/enabling-ebpf.mdx).

### Support for Azure CNI with overlay networking for AKS

We've add supported for Azure CNI with overlay networking for AKS clusters.
This option augments support for the Azure CNI with no overlay where a VNET IP address is assigned to every pod, which can lead to IP address exhaustion.

To review Azure CNI options, see [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../getting-started/kubernetes/managed-public-cloud/aks).

### Improved Felix performance for extremely large clusters

This release adds improvements to how Felix processes active policy rules for clusters with extremely high numbers of endpoints and policy rules.
Previously, calculating selector-based rules in these circumstances could take a long time or end in failure.
Now Felix can perform these calculations quickly while reducing CPU usage by orders of magnitude.

For more information, see [Selector performance in EntityRules](../reference/resources/globalnetworkpolicy.mdx#selector-performance-in-entityrules).
