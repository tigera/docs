## New features and enhancements

### Support for Azure CNI with overlay networking for AKS clusters

We've added supported for Azure CNI with overlay networking for AKS clusters. This option augments support for Azure CNI where a VNET IP address is assigned to every pod, which can lead to IP address exhaustion. To review Azure CNI options, see [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/aks).
