# Calico X.Y release notes

date

### New features

#### HPC-based Windows install and upgrade

We've added support for HPC (HostProcess/Privileged containers) install and upgrade for Windows nodes. {{prodname}} can now bootstrap Windows worker nodes just like Linux worker nodes. Platform engineers can scale Windows worker nodes with an auto-scaling node pool without bootstraping each node manually, and upgrade {{prodname}} deployments without manually upgrading nodes one at a time.

For more information, see [Quickstart](../getting-started/kubernetes/windows-calico/quickstart#install-calico-for-windows-using-hostprocess-containers).

#### ipV6 support for eBPF

We've added support for ipV6 to eBPF, which has more advanced and has better features compared to IPv4. For eBPF details, see [Enable the eBPF dataplane](../operations/ebpf/enabling-ebpf.mdx).
