# Documentation

Welcome to the Calico documentation!
These pages provide technical documentation for Tigera’s Calico products, covering what our products are, how to use the product, and API reference materials.

## What is Calico?

Calico is a cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) that helps you secure, monitor and troubleshoot applications running in containers, Kubernetes, and the cloud.
Calico prevents, detects, troubleshoots and automatically mitigates exposure risks of security issues across the entire container lifecycle.

With Calico, you can specify security and observability as code to ensure consistent enforcement of security and observability policies across multi-cluster, multi-cloud, and hybrid deployments.

## Calico Products

As your organization develops and deploys cloud-native applications, you will encounter increasingly complex networking, security, and observability challenges.
We offer three Calico products designed to help you address them.

### Calico Open Source

Calico Open Source is a free, self-managed networking and security solution for containers, virtual machines, and native host-based workloads.
