# Application layer policy tutorial

This tutorial shows how to use {{prodname}} application layer policy to restrict ingress traffic for applications and microservices.
 
### Install the demo application

We will use a simple microservice application to demonstrate {{prodname}}
application layer policy. The [YAO Bank](https://github.com/projectcalico/yaobank) application creates a
customer-facing web application, a microservice that serves up account
summaries, and an [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) datastore.

```bash
kubectl apply -f {{tutorialFilesURL}}/10-yaobank.yaml
```
```bash
namespace/yaobank configured
service/database created
serviceaccount/database created
deployment.apps/database created
service/summary created
serviceaccount/summary created
deployment.apps/summary created
service/customer created
serviceaccount/customer created
deployment.apps/customer created
```
:::note

You can also
[view the manifest in your browser](/files/10-yaobank.yaml).

:::

Verify that the application pods have been created and are ready.
```bash
    kubectl rollout status deploy/summary deploy/customer deploy/database
```

When the demo application is displayed, you will see three pods.

```
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
customer-2809159614-qqfnx   3/3       Running   0          21h
database-1601951801-m4w70   3/3       Running   0          21h
summary-2817688950-g1b3n    3/3       Running   0          21h
```

## Set up
- A {{prodname}} cluster is running with application layer policy enabled
- Cluster has three microservices: customer, database, summary
- The customer web service should not have access to the backend database, but should have access to clients outside the cluster

Imagine what would happen if an attacker were to gain control of the customer web pod in our
application. Let's simulate this by executing a remote shell inside that pod.

    kubectl exec -ti customer-<fill in pod ID> -c customer -- bash

Notice that from here, we get direct access to the backend database. For example, we can list all the entries in the database like this:

    curl http://database:2379/v2/keys?recursive=true | python -m json.tool

(Piping to `python -m json.tool` nicely formats the output.)


## Apply application layer policy

In this step, we get the application layer policy YAML and apply it. Note that the policy scope is cluster-wide.

With a {{prodname}} policy, you can mitigate risks to the banking application.

   ``` wget {{filesUrl}}/security/tutorials/app-layer-policy/manifests/30-policy.yaml
       kubectl create -f 30-policy.yaml
   ```

Let's examine this policy piece by piece. First, notice that an application layer policy looks like a regular {{prodname}} global network policy. 
The only difference you'll see is the ability to use the application layer policy parameters in global network policy. Another important difference
is that you'll see HTTP traffic flows in Manager UI in features like Service Graph. 

Next, there are three policy objects, one for each microservice.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: customer
spec:
  selector: app == 'customer'
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      http:
        methods: ['GET']
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

The first policy protects the customer web app. Because this application is customer-facing, we do not
restrict what can communicate with it. We do, however, restrict its communications to HTTP `GET`
requests.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: summary
spec:
  selector: app == 'summary'
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      source:
        serviceAccounts:
          names: ['customer']
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

The second policy protects the account summary microservice. We know the only consumer of this
service is the customer web app, so we restrict the source of incoming connections to the service
account for the customer web app.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: database
spec:
  selector: app == 'database'
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      source:
        serviceAccounts:
          names: ["summary"]
  egress:
    - action: Allow

```

The third policy protects the database. Only the summary microservice should have direct access to
the database.

### Verify the policy is working

Let's verify our policy is working as intended. First, return to your browser and refresh to
ensure policy enforcement has not broken the application.

Next, return to the customer web app. Recall that we simulated an attacker gaining control of that
pod by executing a remote shell inside it.

    `kubectl exec -ti customer-<fill in pod ID> -c customer bash`

Repeat our attempt to access the database.

    `curl -I http://database:2379/v2/keys?recursive=true`

We omitted the JSON formatting because we do not expect to get a valid JSON response. This
time we should get a `403 Forbidden` response. Only the account summary microservice has database
access according to our policy.
