# Enable and enforce application layer policies

Application layer policies let you configure access controls based on L7 attributes. 

## Before you begin

### Unsupported
- {{prodname}} implements application layer policy using Envoy as a DaemonSet. This means you cannot use application layer policy alongside a service mesh like Istio.
- eBPF dataplane

### Limitations
- Application layer policy supports restricting only ingress traffic
- Support for L7 attributes are limited to HTTP method and URL exact/prefix path 
- Supported protocols are limited to TCP-based protocols (for example, HTTP, HTTPS, or gRPC)
- You can control application layer policies only at the cluster level (not per namespace) 

## How to
- [Enable application layer policies](#enable-application-layer-policies)
- [Enforce application layer policies for ingress traffic](#enforce-application-layer-policies-for-ingress-traffic)
- [Disable application layer policies](#disable-application-layer-policies)

### Enable application layer policies (ALP)
In the ApplicationLayer custom resource, set the `applicationLayerPolicy` field to Enabled.

```yaml                                                                                           
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: ApplicationLayer
metadata:
  name: tigera-secure 
spec:
  applicationLayerPolicy: Enabled
  
```

### Enforce application layer policies for ingress traffic

You can restrict ingress traffic using HTTP match criteria using Global network policy. 
For a list of all HTTP match parameters, see [Global network policy](/reference/resources/globalnetworkpolicy.mdx).

In the following example, the trading app is allowed ingress traffic only for HTTP GET requests that match the exact path /projects/calico, or that begins with the prefix, /users.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: customer
spec:
  selector: app == 'tradingapp'
  ingress:
   - action: Allow
     http:
       methods: ["GET"]
       paths:
         - exact: "/projects/calico"
         - prefix: "/users"
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```
### Disable application layer policies

To disable the policies, do one of the following steps:
 - Set the `applicationLayerPolicy` field in the `ApplicationLayer` custom resource to `Disabled`.
 - Remove the `applicationLayerPolicy` field entirely.
 - Delete the ApplicationLayer` custom resource.
