# Configure default IP pools

## Big picture

Configure the default IP pool values to use during Tigera Operator installation.

## Value

During Tigera Operator installation, you must configure the CIDR range to use for pods that reflects your environment.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following features:

- **Tigera Operator installation**
- **IPPools**

## Concepts

### Kubernetes pod CIDR

The **Kubernetes pod CIDR** is the expected IP address range for pod IPs. It is defined for the entire cluster, and is used by various Kubernetes components to determine if an IP belongs to a pod. For example, kube-proxy treats traffic differently if an IP is from a pod than if it is not. All pod IPs must be in the CIDR range for Kubernetes to function correctly.

### Tigera Operator and IP pools

[Calico IP pools](../../reference/resources/ippool.mdx) are ranges of IP addresses that Calico uses to assign to pods; the ranges must within the Kubernetes pod CIDR.

The Tigera Operator reads the [Installation](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.Installation)
resource and configures the default Calico IP pool. Note the following:

- Default fields for any that are omitted:
  - CIDR: 192.168.0.0/16
  - Encapsulation: IPIP
  - NodeSelector: all()
  - NATOutgoing: Enabled
- IP pools are only used when Calico is used for pod networking, IP pools are not utilized when using other pod networking solutions.
- To make changes to the IP pools after Tigera Operator install, you may use [calicoctl](../../reference/clis/calicoctl/index.mdx) or kubectl. If you make the changes to the IP Pool in the Installation resource (Operator IPPool) after installation, the the changes are not applied.

## Before you begin...

- Verify that your IP pool is within the Kubernetes pod CIDR
- If you are using encapsulation (IP in IP or VXLAN), ensure that the traffic is allowed on your network
- You are making these changes for a cluster that has not yet had {{prodname}} deployed.

## How to

1. Download the custom-resource.yaml file.
1. Edit the [Installation resource](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.Installation).  
   **Required values**: `cidr:`  
   **Empty values**: Defaulted

   ```bash
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: Installation
   metadata:
     name: default
   spec:
     calicoNetwork:
      ipPools:
         - cidr: "192.168.0.0/16"
           encapsulation: "IPIP"
           nodeSelector: "label == 'value'"
           natOutgoing: "Enabled"
   ```

1. Apply the manifest and continue with your installation as normal.

## Additional resources

- [IP pool resource](../../reference/resources/ippool.mdx)
- Use [calicoctl](../../reference/clis/calicoctl/index.mdx) or `kubectl` to edit the IPPool resource.
