# Provide TLS certificates for Linseed APIs

## Big picture

Provide TLS certificates to secure access to {{prodname}} to the Linseed components.

## Value

Providing TLS certificates for {{prodname}} Linseed components is recommended as part of a zero trust network model for security.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following features:

- **LogStorage** resource

## Before you begin...

By default, {{prodname}} uses self-signed certificates for its Linseed components. To provide TLS certificates,
get the certificate and key pair for the {{prodname}} Linseed using any X.509-compatible tool or from your organization's
Certificate Authority. The certificate must have Common Name or a Subject Alternate Name of `tigera-linseed.tigera-elasticsearch.svc`.

## How to

### Add TLS certificates for PacketCapture

To provide TLS certificates for use by {{prodname}} Linseed components during deployment, you must create a secret before applying the 'custom-resource.yaml' or before creating the LogStorage resource. Use the following command to create a secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic tigera-secure-linseed-cert -n tigera-operator --from-file=tls.crt=</path/to/certificate-file> --from-file=tls.key=</path/to/key-file>
```

To update existing certificates, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic tigera-secure-linseed-cert -n tigera-operator --from-file=tls.crt=</path/to/certificate-file> --from-file=tls.key=</path/to/key-file> --dry-run -o yaml --save-config | kubectl replace -f -
```
