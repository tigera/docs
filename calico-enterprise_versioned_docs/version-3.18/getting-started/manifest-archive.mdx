# Install a patch release

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import ReleaseArchiveTable from "../_includes/components/ReleaseArchiveTable";

Installing the most recent patch version of {{prodname}} {{version}} ensures that you have the latest bug fixes and improvements.
But you can always install, or downgrade to, a previous patch version.
Installing an older patch can help if you encounter problems with the latest patch, or if you're required to install only a specific patch version.

## Before you begin

This feature is:

- Available in 3.0 and later
- Not available for Helm with operator

## How to

1. Download the release archive for your patch version from the following table:

   <ReleaseArchiveTable/>

1. Untar the **release-vx.y.z-vx.y.z.tgz** to a local directory.

   ```bash
   tar xzvf release-vx.y.z-vx.y.z.tgz
   ```

<TabItem label="Kubernetes" value="Kubernetes-0">

In the patch release archive, navigate to the `manifests` folder.

1. Follow the [quickstart installation](install-on-clusters/kubernetes/quickstart.mdx), making the following changes:

   1. Install Tigera operator and custom resource definitions.

      ```bash
      kubectl create -f <your-local-directory-archive>/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
      ```

   2. If you are not using an existing Prometheus operator, install it.

      ```bash
      kubectl create -f <your-local-directory-archive>/manifests/tigera-prometheus-operator.yaml
      ```

   3. Install Tigera custom resources.

      ```bash
      kubectl create -f <your-local-directory-archive>/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
      ```

      :::note

      For platforms like AKS or EKS, you must modify the command to be platform specific.
      EKS example: `kubectl create -f <your-local-directory-archive>/manifests/eks/custom-resources.yaml`

In the patch release archive, navigate to the `ocp-manifests` folder which contains three folders `install-manifests`,
`enterprise-resources`, and `upgrade-manifests`.

- `install-manifests` contains all the manifests needed for minimal OCP cluster.
- `enterprise-resources` contains the {{prodname}} resources.
- `upgrade-manifests` folder contains all the manifests needed for upgrading {{prodname}}.

1. Create the cluster by following [the standard installation](install-on-clusters/openshift/installation.mdx), with the following caveat:

   1. After the Kubernetes manifests directory is generated, copy the files from `install-manifests` instead of downloading the manifests.

      :::note

      Before creating the cluster, be sure to add an image pull secret in `install-manifests/02-pull-secret.yaml`

      :::

1. Install {{prodname}} resources:

   ```bash
   cd <your-local-directory-archive>/ocp-manifests/enterprise-resources && oc create -f
   ```

<TabItem label="Features" value="Features-2">

In the patch release archive, there are additional manifests relating to specific features.

**Examples**

To apply the patch release for threat defense features.

```bash
cd <your-local-directory-archive>/manifests/threatdef && kubectl create -f ejr-vpn.yaml.yaml
cd <your-local-directory-archive>/manifests/threatdef && kubectl create -f tor-exit-feed.yaml
```
