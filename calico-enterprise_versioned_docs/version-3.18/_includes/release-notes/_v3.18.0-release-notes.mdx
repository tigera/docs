### What's new {#whats-new-3.18.0}

#### Support for AKS clusters with Azure CNI with overlay networking

We've add supported for Azure CNI with overlay networking for AKS clusters. This option augments the support for Azure CNI where a VNET IP address is assigned to every pod, which can lead to IP address exhaustion. To review Azure CNI options, see [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/aks).

#### Security event management

This release introduces a new way of reporting events for threat detection in {{prodname}}. Security Events provides useful context on suspicious activity detected in your cluster alongside all of the Kubernetes context, so you can see what workloads are affected. [Security event management](../threat/security-event-management).

#### New performance optimizations for Egress Gateways

{{prodname}} includes new performance options for Egress Gateway Policies that can be used to ensure that application client and gateway pods are on the same cluster node. [Optimize egress networking for workloads with long-lived TCP connections](../networking/egress/egress-gateway-maintenance).

#### Configurable XFF headers for Envoy

{{prodname}} now supports XFF to propagate the original IP address when proxying application layer traffic with Envoy within a Kubernetes cluster. [Installation reference](../reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.EnvoySettings).

#### Alert-only mode for Workload-based Web Application Firewall (WAF)

{{prodname}} now provides a new default mode for WAF that is monitor/event only, enabling operators and security teams to get visibility into the accuracy of rules configured before actively blocking traffic. [Web application firewall](../threat/web-application-firewall).

#### Additional options for Helm-based installs

{{prodname}} includes additional options for Helm installs including the ability to set the number of replicas for certain deployments, node affinity rules, and configuring Wireguard. [Helm installation reference](../reference/installation/helm_customization).

### Known issues {#known-issues-3.18.0}

- TKG v1.x and MKE v3.6 are not supported at this time
- L7 logs with source name `pvt` is not visible in Service Graph
- *Multi-cluster management users only*. If the `manager-tls` and `internal-manager-tls` secrets have overlapping DNS names, components such as `es-calico-kube-controllers` will log certificate errors. If you have previously installed a version older than v3.13.0 and never changed your manager-tls secret from the tigera-operator namespace, you must delete both of these secrets. This applies to you if the following command prints a certificate: `$ kubectl get secret manager-tls -n tigera-operator -o "jsonpath={.data['cert']}"`
- Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.18.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed
