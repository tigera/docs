### What's new {#whats-new-3.18.0}

#### Security event management
This release introduces a new way of reporting events for threat detection in {{prodname}}. Security Events provides useful context on suspicious activity detected in your cluster alongside all of the Kubernetes context, so you can see what workloads are affected. [Security event management](../threat/security-event-management).

#### New performance optimizations for Egress Gateways
{{prodname}} includes new performance options for Egress Gateway Policies that can be used to ensure that application client and gateway pods are on the same cluster node. [Optimize egress networking for workloads with long-lived TCP connections](../networking/egress/egress-gateway-maintenance).

#### Configurable XFF headers for Envoy
{{prodname}} now supports XFF to propagate the original IP address when proxying application layer traffic with Envoy within a Kubernetes cluster. [Installation reference](../reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.EnvoySettings).

#### Alert-only mode for Workload-based Web Application Firewall (WAF)
{{prodname}} now provides a new default mode for WAF that is monitor/event only, enabling operators and security teams to get visibility into the accuracy of rules configured before actively blocking traffic. [Web application firewall](../threat/web-application-firewall).

#### Additional options for Helm-based installs
{{prodname}} includes additional options for Helm installs including the ability to set the number of replicas for certain deployments, node affinity rules, and configuring Wireguard. [Helm installation reference](../reference/installation/helm_customization).

### Known issues {#known-issues-3.18.0}

- TKG v1.x and MKE v3.6 are not supported at this time
- L7 logs with source name `pvt` is not visible in Service Graph
- *Multi-cluster management users only*. If the `manager-tls` and `internal-manager-tls` secrets have overlapping DNS names, components such as `es-calico-kube-controllers` will log certificate errors. If you have previously installed a version older than v3.13.0 and never changed your manager-tls secret from the tigera-operator namespace, you must delete both of these secrets. This applies to you if the following command prints a certificate: `$ kubectl get secret manager-tls -n tigera-operator -o "jsonpath={.data['cert']}"`
- Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.18.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed
