### Step 1: (Optional) Configure access for the non-cluster-host

To run Calico Node as a container, it will need a kubeconfig. You can skip this step if you already have a kubeconfig ready to use.

<CreateKubeconfig />

Run the following two commands to create a cluster role with read-only access and a corresponding cluster role binding.

```bash
kubectl apply -f $[filesUrl]/manifests/non-cluster-host-clusterrole.yaml
kubectl create clusterrolebinding $SA_NAME --serviceaccount=calico-system:$SA_NAME --clusterrole=non-cluster-host-read-only
```

:::note

We include examples for systemd, but the commands can be
applied to other init daemons such as upstart.
