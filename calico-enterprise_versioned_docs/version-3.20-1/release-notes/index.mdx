# Calico Enterprise 3.20 release notes

:::info early preview release

Calico Enterprise 3.20 can be used for previewing and testing purposes only.
It is not supported for use in production.

:::

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of {{prodname}}.

## New features and enhancements

### Support for OpenShift hosted control planes

You can now install Calico Enterprise on OpenShift clusters that use hosted control planes.

For more information, see [Installing Calico Enterprise on an OpenShift HCP cluster](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/openshift/hostedcontrolplanes.mdx)

### Packet capture and compliance reports are disabled by default

We've changed the default behavior for packet capturing and compliance reporting.
These features are now disabled by default. You can enable either feature during installation, later via the Manager UI, or by running a kubectl command.
For [Helm installations](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/kubernetes/helm#install-calico-enterprise), update the values in the values.yaml file.
To use the Compliance Reports feature, ensure it is enabled in the management cluster before enabling it in the managed cluster.

:::note Update Note
If you're upgrading to Calico Enterprise 3.20 and want to continue using packet capture, create a [PacketCaptureAPI CR](../visibility/packetcapture#enable-packet-capture-using-kubectl) during the upgrade to maintain the enabled status.
For [Helm upgrades](../getting-started/upgrading/upgrading-enterprise/kubernetes-upgrade-tsee/helm#upgrade-from-313-or-later), include the compliance and packetcaptureAPI flags in the `values.yaml` file to maintain the enabled status.

For more information, see [Enable Packet capture](../visibility/packetcapture#enable-packet-capture) and [Enable compliance reports](../compliance/enable-compliance.mdx)

## Deprecated and removed features

* The honeypods feature has been removed from this release.

## Bug fixes

* WAF events now include source information such as IP and namespace from where the event originated from.
* Fix that Felix would panic when trying to resync a temporary IP set. Temporary IP sets are created in certain scenarios after previous failures.

## Known issues

* Flow logs for the Windows workloads currently do not display entries with a Deny action.
* Before upgrading a {{prodname}} cluster on MKE v3.6 to the latest {{prodname}} version: 1) upgrade MKE from 3.6 to 3.7, then 2) upgrade {{prodname}}.
* L7 logs with source name `pvt` is not visible in Service Graph.
* Calico panics if kube-proxy or other components are using native `nftables` rules instead of the `iptables-nft` compatibility shim. Until Calico supports native nftables mode, we recommend that you continue to use the iptables-nft compatibility layer for all components. (The compatibility layer was the only option before Kubernetes v1.29 added alpha-level `nftables` support.) Do not run Calico in "legacy" iptables mode on a system that is also using `nftables`. Although this combination does not panic or fail (at least on kernels that support both), the interaction between `iptables` "legacy" mode and `nftables` is confusing: both `iptables` and `nftables` rules can be executed on the same packet, leading to policy verdicts being "overturned".
