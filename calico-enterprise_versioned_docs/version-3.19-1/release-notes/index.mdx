:::

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of {{prodname}}.

## New features and enhancements

### Improved flow log filtering for destination domains

Weâ€™ve updated the Felix parameter (`dest_domains`) for DNS policy to make it easy to find only domain names that the deployment connected to (not all the domain names that got translated to the same IP address).
For more information, see [Flow log data types](../visibility/elastic/flow/datatypes.mdx).

### New flow logs panel on Endpoints page

We've updated the Endpoints page in Manager UI with a new flow logs panel so you can view and filter Endpoints associated with denied traffic. Flow log metadata includes the source, destination, ports, protocols, and other key forms. We've also updated the Policy Board to highlight policies with denied traffic.

### Improvements to security events dashboard

We've added the following improvements to the [Security events dashboard](../threat/security-event-management):

- Jira and Slack webhook integration for security event alerts

  By [configuring security event alerts](../threat/configuring-webhooks), you can push security event alerts to Slack, Jira, or an external HTTP endpoint of your choice.
  This lets incident response and security teams to use native tools to respond to security event alerts.

- Added threat feed alerts

  If you have implemented global threat feeds for suspicious activity (domains or suspicious IPs), alerts are now visible in the Security Overview dashboard.
  For more information on threat feeds, see [Trace and block suspicious IPs](../threat/suspicious-ips).

## Deprecated and removed features

* The FIPS mode feature is removed in this release.
* The AWS security groups integration is removed in this release.
  It will be removed in Calico Enterprise 3.19.
* The ingress log collection feature is removed in this release.
* The [manual installation method for Windows](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/windows-calico/manual-install/) is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  The recommended installation method is now [operator-based](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/windows-calico/operator).

## Technology Preview features

- [Web application firewall](../threat/web-application-firewall)

   Protect cloud-native applications from application layer attacks.

- [Security events management](../threat/security-event-management)

   Get alerts on security events that may indicate a threat is present in your Kubernetes cluster.

- [DNS policy for Windows](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/windows-calico/limitations#dns-policy-limitations)

   Use domain names in policies to identify services outside the cluster, which is often operationally simpler and more robust than using IP addresses.

## Known issues

* Flow logs for the Windows workloads currently do not display entries with a Deny action.
* Before upgrading a {{prodname}} cluster on MKE v3.6 to the latest {{prodname}} version: 1) upgrade MKE from 3.6 to 3.7, then 2) upgrade {{prodname}}.
* L7 logs with source name `pvt` is not visible in Service Graph.
* *Multi-cluster management users only*. If the `manager-tls` and `internal-manager-tls` secrets have overlapping DNS names, components such as `es-calico-kube-controllers` will log certificate errors. If you have previously installed a version older than v3.13.0 and never changed your manager-tls secret from the tigera-operator namespace, you must delete both of these secrets. This applies to you if the following command prints a certificate: `$ kubectl get secret manager-tls -n tigera-operator -o "jsonpath={.data['cert']}"`.
* Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.18.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed.
* Calico panics if kube-proxy or other components are using native `nftables` rules instead of the `iptables-nft` compatibility shim. Until Calico supports native nftables mode, we recommend that you continue to use the iptables-nft compatibility layer for all components. (The compatibility layer was the only option before Kubernetes v1.29 added alpha-level `nftables` support.) Do not run Calico in "legacy" iptables mode on a system that is also using `nftables`. Although this combination does not panic or fail (at least on kernels that support both), the interaction between `iptables` "legacy" mode and `nftables` is confusing: both `iptables` and `nftables` rules can be executed on the same packet, leading to policy verdicts being "overturned".
* When a tier order is set to the maximum float value (1.7976931348623157e+308), this can cause policy re-ordering in the UI not to work properly. Since the `namespace-isolation` tier has this value by default, policy recommendation users are affected. To workaround this issue edit any tier that has this value for the order. For example: use `kubectl edit tier namespace-isolation` and set the order to `10000`.
