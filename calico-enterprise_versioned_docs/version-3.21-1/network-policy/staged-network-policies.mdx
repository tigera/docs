# Stage, preview impacts, and enforce policy

## Big picture

Stage and preview impacts on traffic before enforcing policy.

## Value

$[prodname] staged network policy resources lets you test the traffic impact of the policy as if it were enforced, but without changing traffic flow. You can also preview the impacts of a staged policy on existing traffic. By verifying that correct flows are allowed and denied before enforcement, you can minimize misconfiguration and potential network disruption.

## Concepts

### About staged policies

The following staged policy resources have the same structure (i.e. the resource spec has the same fields) as their “enforced” counterpart.

- Staged global network policy
- Staged network policy
- Staged Kubernetes network policy

### Review permissions

The default `tigera-network-admin` cluster role has the required permissions to manage the different enforced
and staged network policies. Adjust permissions for your environment. As with $[prodname] network policy and global network policies, the RBAC for $[prodname] staged network policy and staged global network policy is tier-dependent.

## How to

- [Create a policy recommendation](#create-a-policy-recommendation)
- [Stage a policy](#stage-a-policy)
- [Preview policy impact](#preview-policy-impact)
- [Enforce a staged policy](#enforce-a-staged-policy)
- [Stage updates to an enforced policy](#stage-updates-to-an-enforced-policy)

### Create a policy recommendation

One of the first things developers need to do is secure unprotected workloads with network policy. (For example, by default, Kubernetes pods accept traffic from any source.) The **Recommend policy** feature allows developers with minimal experience writing policy to secure workloads.

Because **Recommend policy** looks at historical flow log entries that match your request, you should run your workloads for a reasonable amount of time to get "typical network traffic" for your application.

1. In the left navbar, click **Policies**.
1. Click **Recommend a policy**.
1. Enter time range, Namespace, Name, and click **Recommend**.
1. If relevant flow logs are found within the time range for the workload endpoint, click **Preview** to assess the impact of the recommended policy, or **Stage**.

### Stage a policy

Stage a policy to test it in a near replica of a production environment. A best practice is to stage a policy before enforcing it to avoid unintentionally exposing or blocking other network traffic.

1. In the left navbar, click **Policies**.
1. In a tier, click **Add Policy**.
1. Create your policy and click **Stage** to save and stage it.

### Enforce a staged policy

1. From **Policies Board**, click a staged policy.
1. Click **Edit policy**, make changes and click **Enforce**. The staged policy is deleted and the enforced policy is created/updated (depending on whether it already exists).

### Preview policy impact

The policy preview impact feature assesses traffic impact only on _enforced staged policies_.

1. From the **Policies Board**, select a staged policy and click **Edit policy**.
1. Make some edits and click **Preview**.

The following example shows denied flows that may or may not be intended.

### Stage updates to an enforced policy

1. From the **Policies Board**, open an enforced policy.
1. In **View Policy**, click **Edit policy**.
1. Make your changes, and click **Preview**. Depending on the results, you can click **Stage** or **Enforce**.

You can also use custom resources to stage Kubernetes and $[prodname] policies, and apply them using `kubectl`. Here are sample YAML files.

**Example: StagedGlobalNetworkPolicy**

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: StagedGlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default.allow-tcp-6379
spec:
  tier: default
  selector: role == 'database'
  types:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: role == 'frontend'
      destination:
        ports:
          - 6379
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

**Example: StagedNetworkPolicy**

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: StagedNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default.allow-tcp-6379
  namespace: default
spec:
  tier: default
  selector: role == 'database'
  types:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: role == 'frontend'
      destination:
        ports:
          - 6379
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

**Example: StagedKubernetesNetworkPolicy**

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: StagedKubernetesNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-network-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
            except:
              - 172.17.1.0/24
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              project: myproject
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              role: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 6379
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5978
```
