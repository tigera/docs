# Platform support policy

This overview summarizes the $[prodname] policies for supporting and testing third-party platforms for $[prodname].

See the documentation for your version of $[prodname] for specific platform versions that are supported. Note that supported versions for platforms are finalized approximately two weeks before a $[prodname] release is GA.

## Kubernetes

Upstream Kubernetes releases new versions approximately four times per year as stated in their [Release Cycle documentation](https://kubernetes.io/releases/release/).

$[prodname] supports the last three versions of Kubernetes at time of $[prodname] release. For example, if 1.22 is the latest version at time of release, then 1.22, 1.21, and 1.20 are the supported versions upon release.

## Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

$[prodname] supports the latest version of AKS at time of $[prodname] release, as stated in the system requirements.

## Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

$[prodname] supports the latest version of EKS at time of $[prodname] release, as stated in the system requirements.

## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

$[prodname] supports the latest version of [GKE regular channel](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels) at time of $[prodname] release, as stated in the system requirements.

## Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE)

$[prodname] supports the latest version of MKE at time of $[prodname] release, as stated in the system requirements.

## Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)

Red Hat releases a new version of OpenShift approximately every four months according to their lifecycle support policy. Even numbered releases (4.6, 4.8, etc.) are Extended Update Support (EUS) releases that provide an upgrade path to the next EUS.

If the last three versions of OpenShift contain two EUS releases, then $[prodname] will support all three versions upon release to provide customers with an easier upgrade path. If the last three versions contain only one EUS, then $[prodname] will only support the last two versions of OpenShift upon release.

See the OpenShift system requirements for more information on a specific release of $[prodname].

## Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)

$[prodname] supports the latest version of RKE at time of $[prodname] release, as stated in the system requirements.

## Rancher's Next Generation Kubernetes Distribution (RKE2)

$[prodname] supports the versions of RKE2 that align with supported kubernetes versions in $[prodname] release, as stated in the system requirements.
