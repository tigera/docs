# CIS benchmark report

To create a CIS benchmark report, create a `GlobalReport` with the `reportType` set to `cis-benchmark`.

The following sample command uses a GlobalReport to create a daily CIS benchmark report that run on all the nodes.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata:
  name: daily-cis-benchmark-report
spec:
  reportType: cis-benchmark
  schedule: 0 0 * * *
EOF
```

## Openshift

While there is no extra setup configuration required by the user to generate a benchmark report for Openshift, the result sets will be different than a report generated for regular Kubernetes clusters. Use the [Openshift Container Platform Security Guide](https://static.open-scap.org/ssg-guides/ssg-ocp4-guide-index.html) to cross-reference the benchmark results.
