## New features and enhancements

### Introducing Calico Ingress Gateway (tech-preview)

$[prodname] now includes the ability to deploy Calico Ingress Gateway which is an Enterprise hardened, 100% upstream distribution of Envoy Gateway.
Envoy Gateway is an implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API with several extensions that provide advanced security and traffic management features.

For more information, see [Configure an ingress gateway](../networking/gateway-api.mdx).

### IPAM for load balancers

$[prodname] now extends its IPAM capabilities to support service LoadBalancer IP allocation, providing a centralized, automated approach to managing LoadBalancer IPs within Kubernetes clusters.

For more information, see [Link to documentation](../networking/ipam/service-loadbalancer.mdx)

### Enhancements

* **Control-plane label customization for AKS:**
  We added support for control-plane label customization for AKS clusters.
  This gives you greater control over how labels are applied during installation.

* **Log levels for api-server component:**
  You can now tune the log level for the API server to better support production deployments and troubleshooting scenarios.

* **Clusterrolebindings have reduced privileges:**
  Clusterrolebindings for the `tigera-operator`, `calico-kube-controller`, and `calico-prometheus-operator` components have been changed to improve $[prodname]'s least-privileged security model.
