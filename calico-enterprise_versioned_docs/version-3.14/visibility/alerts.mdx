# Configure alerts

## Big picture

Define alert criteria for the Alerts page in {{prodname}} Manager based on collected flow, DNS, and audit logs.

## Value

When it comes to alerts that indicate cluster compromise, cluster administrator need flexibility to ensure fine-grain tuning; too many alerts become noise. With {{prodname}}, you can configure alerts to detect log entries that match patterns, or aggregate log entries over key fields and alert when entry counts or metrics on aggregated fields meet a condition. For higher fidelity, you can use the alerts domain-specific query language to select only relevant data.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{prodname}} features:

- **GlobalAlert** resource

## Before you begin...

**Required**

Privileges to manage GlobalAlert

**Recommended**

We recommend that you turn down the aggregation of flow logs sent to Elasticsearch for configuring threat feeds. If you do not adjust flow logs, {{prodname}} aggregates over the external IPs for allowed traffic, and alerts will not provide pod-specific results (unless the traffic is denied by policy). Go to: [FelixConfiguration](../reference/resources/felixconfig.mdx) and set the field, **flowLogsFileAggregationKindForAllowed** to **1**.

## How To

### Create a global alert

1. Create a yaml file containing one or more alerts.
1. Apply the alert to your cluster.

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f <your_alert_filename>
   ```

1. Wait until the alert runs, and check the status.

   ```shell
   kubectl get globalalert <your_alert_name> -o yaml
   ```

1. In {{prodname}} Manager, go the **Alerts** page to view events
   as alert conditions are satisfied.

### Examples

Following is the basic example to trigger the alert when we see 100 flows in the entire cluster in last 5 mins.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalAlert
metadata:
  name: example-flows
spec:
  description: '100 flows Example'
  summary: 'Flows example ${count} > 100'
  severity: 100
  dataSet: flows
  metric: count
  condition: gt
  threshold: 100
```

In the following example, we detect ssh traffic in default namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalAlert
metadata:
  name: network.ssh
spec:
  description: 'ssh flows to default namespace'
  summary: '[flows] ssh flow in default namespace detected from ${source_namespace}/${source_name_aggr}'
  severity: 100
  period: 10m
  lookback: 10m
  dataSet: flows
  query: proto='tcp' AND action='allow' AND dest_port='22' AND (source_namespace='default' OR dest_namespace='default') AND reporter=src
  aggregateBy: [source_namespace, source_name_aggr]
  field: num_flows
  metric: sum
  condition: gt
  threshold: 0
```

In the following example, we are monitoring privilege access within your cluster and detect any modification to `globalnetworksets`.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalAlert
metadata:
  name: policy.globalnetworkset
spec:
  description: 'Changed globalnetworkset'
  summary: '[audit] [privileged access] change detected for ${objectRef.resource} ${objectRef.name}'
  severity: 100
  period: 10m
  lookback: 10m
  dataSet: audit
  query: (verb=create OR verb=update OR verb=delete OR verb=patch) AND "objectRef.resource"=globalnetworksets
  aggregateBy: [objectRef.resource, objectRef.name]
  metric: count
  condition: gt
  threshold: 0
```

In the following example, we generate alerts for processes in a small set.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalAlert
metadata:
  name: example-process-set-embedded
spec:
  description: Generate alerts for all flows from processes in the set
  summary: Generate alerts for all flows from processes in the set
  severity: 100
  dataSet: flows
  query: process_name IN {"python?", "*checkoutservice"}
```

In the following example, we generate alerts for DNS lookups that are not in the allowed domain set.
Since this set can be potentially large, we will use a variable in the query string and reference it from the `substitutions` list.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalAlert
metadata:
  name: example-domain-set-variable
spec:
  description: Generate alerts for all DNS lookups not in the domain set
  summary: Generate alerts for all DNS lookups not in the domain set with variable
  severity: 100
  dataSet: dns
  query: qname NOTIN ${domains}
  substitutions:
    - name: domains
      values:
        - '*cluster.local'
        - '?.mydomain.com'
```

## Templates

{{prodname}} includes a set of Alert templates. These are used
by the {{prodname}} Manager to create alerts
for common tasks that can then be modified to suit your needs.
