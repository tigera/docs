# Monitor honeypods

## Big picture

Monitor honeypod behavior to gain insight on what attackers are doing using packet-level inspection.

## Value

Adding monitoring to honeypods improves your ability to detect and confirm known threats by analyzing and alerting on network traffic to honeypods that match any Intrusion Detection System (Snort) signatures.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{prodname}} features:

- **PacketCapture** with **Honeypod controller**

## Concepts

### About monitoring honeypods

Honeypods can optionally be monitored using a {{prodname}} controller that periodically polls selected honeypods for suspicious activity and scans its traffic. Alerts are generated in the Events tab of {{prodname}} Manager UI.

The controller leverages the following:

- [Packet capture feature](../../visibility/packetcapture.mdx) to collect honeypod traffic in clusters.
- Open source [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) to scan honeypod traffic.

## Before you begin

### Required

[Honeypods are configured](honeypods.mdx) for clusters, and alerts are generated when the honeypods are accessed.

## How To

- [Enable packet capture on honeypods](#enable-packet-capture-on-honeypods)
- [Add honeypod controller to cluster](#add-honeypod-controller-to-cluster)
- [Add custom Snort rules](#add-custom-snort-rules)
- [Verify the honeypod controller](#verify-the-honeypod-controller)

### Enable packet capture on honeypods

The following manifest enables packet capture on default [honeypods](honeypods.mdx).
Be sure to modify the namespace and selector if honeypods are placed elsewhere.
For help, see [PacketCapture](../../visibility/packetcapture.mdx).

```bash
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: PacketCapture
metadata:
  name: capture-honey
  namespace: tigera-internal
spec:
  selector: all()
EOF
```

In order for the honeypod controller to find the packet captures, the name `capture-honey` is required for the PacketCapture resource.

### Add honeypod controller to cluster

:::note

If youâ€™ve customized or created your own honeypods, be sure to modify the included `capture-honey` [PacketCapture](../../visibility/packetcapture.mdx) manifest to target your honeypods.

:::

Add the honeypod controller to each cluster configured for honeypods using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f {{filesUrl}}/manifests/threatdef/honeypod/controller.yaml
```

For OpenShift deployments, the controller requires privileged access:

```bash
kubectl apply -f {{filesUrl}}/manifests/threatdef/honeypod/controller_os.yaml
```

### Add custom Snort rules

You can add custom Snort rules to the controller using a ConfigMap. By default, {{prodname}} uses the [Snort Community Ruleset](https://www.snort.org/downloads/#rule-downloads).

The following manifest provides the method to add individual custom signatures:

```bash
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: localrule
  namespace: tigera-intrusion-detection
data:
  rules: |
    alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Echo Request"; itype:8; sid:1000000;)
    alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Echo Reply"; itype:0; sid:1000001;)
EOF
```

Refer to [Snort Users Manual](https://www.snort.org/#documents) for writing Snort signatures.

To add a Snort-compatible ruleset file:

```bash
kubectl create cm localrule -n tigera-intrusion-detection --from-file=rules=<SNORT-RULESET-LOCATION>
```

:::note

The size limit for ConfigMaps is 1 MiB. If more space is required, use an alternative method to mount the volume.

:::

Update the controller deployment to include the ConfigMap. **Important!** The mountPath `/etc/snort/rules/custom.rules` is required and the path cannot be changed.

```bash
cat <<EOF > patch.yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: controller
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /etc/snort/rules/custom.rules
          subPath: custom.rules
          name: custom-rules
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: custom-rules
        configMap:
          name: localrule
          items:
          - key: "rules"
            path: "custom.rules"
EOF
```

Apply the patch to the `honeypod-controller` DaemonSet:

```bash
kubectl patch daemonset honeypod-controller -n tigera-intrusion-detection --patch "$(cat patch.yaml)"
```

### Verify the honeypod controller

To verify the installation, ensure that honeypod controller is running within the `tigera-intrusion-detection` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n tigera-intrusion-detection
```

```shell
NAME                                             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
honeypod-controller-57vwk                        1/1     Running     0          22s
honeypod-controller-8vtj6                        1/1     Running     0          22s
honeypod-controller-gk524                        1/1     Running     0          22s
honeypod-controller-k9nz4                        1/1     Running     0          22s
intrusion-detection-controller-bf9794dd7-5qxjs   1/1     Running     0          15m
intrusion-detection-es-job-installer-nfd7t       0/1     Completed   0          15m

```

As an example, to trigger an alert for the example custom signature, first get the Pod IP for one of the honeypods:

```bash
kubectl get pod tigera-internal-app-57vwk -n tigera-internal -ojsonpath='{.status.podIP}'
```

Then run a `busybox` container with the command `ping` on the honeypod IP:

```bash
kubectl run --restart=Never --image busybox ping-runner -- ping -c1 <honeypod IP>
```

An alert will be generated for `honeypod-controller.snort` with the example custom signature.
