## What's new

### Early Preview releases

{{prodname}} now includes the Early Preview designation for minor releases. Early Preview releases (denoted by a .0 patch version, e.g. 3.14.0) enable our customers to validate and test new versions of {{prodname}} in test and staging environments before they go GA.

### Support for Rancher RKE2

New and existing users of Rancher can install {{prodname}} on RKE2, Rancher's next generation Kubernetes Distribution. [Link to documentation](../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/rke2.mdx)

### BYO CNI on Azure AKS

{{prodname}} now supports the new BYOCNI option for AKS, which enables customers to use Calico as a CNI on AKS clusters for improved IPAM and advanced networking features. [Link to documentation](../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/aks.mdx)

### Included updates from Calico OSS

{{prodname}} also includes new features and fixes from Calico OSS. For more details on these changes please see the [release notes here.](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/archive/v3.23/release-notes)

## Known issues for this Preview

- Upgrading {{prodname}} from v3.12.0 and earlier to v3.14.0 using helm charts is not supported at this time.
- Installing {{prodname}} v3.14.0 on Mirantis MKE using helm charts is not supported at this time.
- Upgrading {{prodname}} v3.14.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} v3.11.0, v3.11.1, v3.11.2, v3.12.0 and v3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
- Mirantis MKE has provisional support due to upgrade issues on that platform. Please contact our support team for upgrades or deployments on Mirantis MKE.
- Multi-cluster Management: Starting with v3.6 the Intrusion Detection Job Installer was removed from Managed clusters. If you are running a Managed cluster v3.5 or older connected to a Management cluster v3.6 or newer, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade your Managed cluster to at least v3.6. See [Upgrade Instructions](../../getting-started/upgrading/upgrading-enterprise/index.mdx).
