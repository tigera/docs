If you are not sure which IPAM your cluster is using, the way to tell depends on install method.

The IPAM plugin can be queried on the default Installation resource.

```
kubectl get installation default -o go-template --template {{.spec.cni.ipam.type}}
```

If your cluster is using Calico IPAM, the above command should return a result of `Calico`.
