## Policy query with calicoq

Once {{prodname}} is installed in OpenShift, each node is automatically configured with
a `calicoctl.cfg` (owned by the root user) which is used by {{prodname}} to locate and authenticate requests to etcd.

We recommend installing `calicoq` as a container in OpenShift. Refer to [Installing calicoq as a container on a single host](../../operations/clis/calicoq/index.mdx#install-calicoq-as-a-container-on-a-single-host) for instructions.

:::note

Ensure that your configuration takes into account TLS-enabled etcd in OpenShift.
