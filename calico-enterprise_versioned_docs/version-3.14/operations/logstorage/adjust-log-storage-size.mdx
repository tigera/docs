# Adjust log storage size

## Big picture

Adjust the size of the {{prodname}} log storage during or after installation.

## Value

By default, {{prodname}} creates the log storage with a single node. This makes it easy to get started using {{prodname}}.
Generally, a single node for logs is fine for test or development purposes. Before going to production, you should scale
the number of nodes, replicas, CPU, and memory to reflect a production environment.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{prodname}} features:

- **LogStorage** resource

## Concepts

### Log storage terms

| Term    | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| node    | A running instance of the log storage.                                                                                                              |
| cluster | A collection of nodes. Multiple nodes protect the cluster from any single node failing, and lets you scale resources (CPU, memory, storage space) . |
| replica | A copy of data. Replicas protect against data loss if a node fails. The number of replicas must be less than the number of nodes.                   |

## Before you begin...

**Review log storage recommendations**

Review [Log storage recommendations](log-storage-recommendations.mdx) for guidance on the number of nodes and resources to configure for your environment.

## How to

- [Adjusting LogStorage](#adjusting-logstorage)

:::caution

If you are not using a dynamic provisioner, make sure there is an available persistent volume before updating the resource requirements (cpu, memory, storage) in this section. To check that a persistent volume has the status of `Available`, run this command: `kubectl get pv | grep tigera-elasticsearch`

:::

### Adjusting LogStorage

In the following example, {{prodname}} is configured to install 3 nodes that have 200Gi of storage each with 1 replica. Whenever the storage size is modified, resourceRequirements must be revisited respectively to support these changes.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: LogStorage
metadata:
  name: tigera-secure
spec:
  indices:
    replicas: 1
  nodes:
    count: 3
      # This section sets the resource requirements for each individual Elasticsearch node.
    resourceRequirements:
      limits:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 16Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 16Gi
        storage: 200Gi
  componentResources:
    - componentName: ECKOperator
        # This section sets the resource requirements for the operator that bootstraps the Elasticsearch cluster.
      resourceRequirements:
        limits:
          memory: 512Mi
        requests:
          memory: 512Mi
```
