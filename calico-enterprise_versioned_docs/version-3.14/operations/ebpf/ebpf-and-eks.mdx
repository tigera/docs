# Create an EKS cluster for eBPF mode

## Big picture

This guide explains how to set up an EKS cluster with a recent-enough Linux kernel to run the eBPF dataplane.

## Value

By default, EKS uses an older version of the Linux kernel in its base image, which is not compatible with {{prodname}}'s
eBPF mode. This guide explains how to set up a cluster using a base image with a recent-enough kernel.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{prodname}} features:

- **EKS Support**
- **calico/node**
- **eBPF dataplane**

## Concepts

### eBPF

eBPF (or "extended Berkeley Packet Filter"), is a technology that allows safe mini programs to be attached to various
low-level hooks in the Linux kernel. eBPF has a wide variety of uses, including networking, security, and tracing.
You’ll see a lot of non-networking projects leveraging eBPF, but for {{prodname}} our focus is on networking,
and in particular, pushing the networking capabilities of the latest Linux kernels to the limit.

### EKS

EKS is Amazon's managed Kubernetes offering.

## How to

### Create an eBPF compatible EKS cluster

By default, EKS uses Amazon Linux 2 as its base image for EKS, which does not meet the kernel version requirement for
eBPF mode. Below, we give a couple of options for how to get the cluster running with a suitable kernel:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Bottlerocket" value="Bottlerocket-0">

The easiest way to start an EKS cluster that meets eBPF mode's requirements is to use Amazon's
[Bottlerocket](https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/) OS, instead of the default. Bottlerocket is a
container-optimised OS with an emphasis on security; it has a version of the kernel which is compatible with eBPF mode.

- To create a 4-node test cluster with a Bottlerocket node group, run the command below. It is important to use the config-file
  approach to creating a cluster in order to set the additional IAM permissions for Bottlerocket.

  ```
  eksctl create cluster --config-file - <<EOF
  apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
  kind: ClusterConfig
  metadata:
    name: my-calico-cluster
    region: us-west-2
    version: '1.18'
  nodeGroups:
    - name: ng-my-calico-cluster
      instanceType: t3.xlarge
      minSize: 0
      maxSize: 4
      desiredCapacity: 4
      amiFamily: Bottlerocket
      iam:
        attachPolicyARNs:
        - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy
        - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy
        - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly
        - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
  EOF
  ```

- Follow the instructions in the [getting started guide](../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/eks.mdx) to install {{prodname}}
  using the Amazon VPC CNI (Calico CNI cannot be installed on Bottlerocket at this time), with the following tweak:

  Set `spec.flexVolumePath` to `/var/lib/kubelet/plugins` in the `Installation` resource in the `custom-resources.yaml`.
  This can be done by editing `custom-resources.yaml` or by applying the YAML and then immediately running the following command to
  patch the `Installation` resource:

  ```bash
  kubectl patch installation.operator.tigera.io default --type merge -p '{"spec":{"flexVolumePath":"/var/lib/kubelet/plugins"}}'
  ```

  This tweak is required for Bottlerocket compatibility.

<TabItem label="Custom AMI" value="Custom AMI-1">

If you are familiar with the AMI creation process, it is also possible to create a custom AMI based on Ubuntu 20.04,
which is suitable:

- Create an EKS cluster with a nodeGroup that uses `amiFamily=Ubuntu1804`

- Log into a worker instance with `ssh` and upgrade it to Ubuntu 20.04.

- [Save the instance off as a custom AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html)
  and make a note of the AMI ID

- Delete the EKS cluster.

- Using `eksctl`: start your cluster without an initial node group; this allows for customising the CNI configuration before
  it is rolled out:

  ```
  eksctl create cluster \
   --name my-calico-cluster \
   --version 1.18 \
   --with-oidc \
   --without-nodegroup
  ```

- Follow the instructions in the [getting started guide](../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/eks.mdx) to install {{prodname}}
  but when instructed to create the node group, use the AMI saved off above:

  - `--node-ami` should be set to the AMI ID of the image built above.
  - `--node-ami-family` should be set to `Ubuntu1804` (despite the upgrade).

  - For example:

    ```
    eksctl create nodegroup \
      --cluster my-calico-cluster \
      --node-type t3.xlarge \
      --max-pods-per-node 100 \
      --node-ami-family Ubuntu1804 \
      --node-ami <AMI ID> \
      --max-pods-per-node 100
    ```

    :::note

    Without the `--max-pods-per-node` option above, EKS will limit the
    [number of pods based on node-type](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/eni-max-pods.txt).
    See `eksctl create nodegroup --help` for the full set of node group options.

### Configure {{prodname}} to connect directly to the API server

When configuring {{prodname}} to connect to the API server, we need to use the load balanced domain name
created by EKS. It can be extracted from `kube-proxy`'s config map by running:

```
kubectl get cm -n kube-system kube-proxy -o yaml | grep server
```

which should show the server name, for example:

```
    server: https://d881b853ae9313e00302a84f1e346a77.gr7.us-west-2.eks.amazonaws.com
```

In this example, you would use `d881b853ae9313e00302a84f1e346a77.gr7.us-west-2.eks.amazonaws.com` for `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`
and `443` (the default for HTTPS) for `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT` when creating the config map.

Since we used the operator to install {{prodname}}, create the following config map in the
`tigera-operator` namespace using the host and port determined above:

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-services-endpoint
  namespace: tigera-operator
data:
  KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST: "<API server host>"
  KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT: "443"
EOF
```

### Disable kube-proxy

In eBPF mode, {{prodname}} replaces `kube-proxy` so it wastes resources to run both. To disable `kube-proxy` reversibly, we recommend adding a node selector to `kube-proxy`'s `DaemonSet` that matches no nodes, for example:

```
kubectl patch ds -n kube-system kube-proxy -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"non-calico": "true"}}}}}'
```

Then, should you want to start `kube-proxy` again, you can simply remove the node selector.

### Enable eBPF mode

To enable eBPF mode, change the `spec.calicoNetwork.linuxDataplane` parameter in
the operator's `Installation` resource to `"BPF"`; you must also clear the hostPorts setting because host ports are not supported in BPF mode:

```bash
kubectl patch installation.operator.tigera.io default --type merge -p '{"spec":{"calicoNetwork":{"linuxDataplane":"BPF", "hostPorts":null}}}'
```

:::note

the operator rolls out the change with a rolling update which means that some nodes will be in eBPF mode
before others. This can disrupt the flow of traffic through node ports. We plan to improve this in an upcoming release
by having the operator do the update in two phases.

:::

## How to disable eBPF mode

Follow these steps if you want to switch from Calico's eBPF dataplane back to standard Linux networking:

- Revert the changes to the operator's installation resource:

  ```bash
  kubectl patch installation.operator.tigera.io default --type merge -p '{"spec":{"calicoNetwork":{"linuxDataplane":"Iptables"}}}'
  ```

- If you disabled `kube-proxy`, re-enable it (for example, by removing the node selector added above).

  ```
  kubectl patch ds -n kube-system kube-proxy --type merge -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"non-calico": null}}}}}'
  ```

- Since disabling eBPF mode is disruptive, monitor existing workloads to make sure they reestablish connections.
