# Configure user roles and permissions

## Big picture

Configure roles using Kubernetes RBAC and lock down user permissions to {{prodname}} features and functions.

## Value

Self-service is an important part of your Kubernetes platform networking and network security. When you allow developers to define policies with guardrails, you create more self-service in the CI/CD process. But network security architects require assurances that developers can access only the resources they are entitled to.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{prodname}} features:

- **Calico Enterprise API server**

## Concepts

### Kubernetes RBAC authorization

The [Calico Enterprise API server](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.APIServer) is an extension to the standard [Kubernetes RBAC Authorization APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/). You configure fine-grained user permissions using `Role`, `ClusterRole`, `RoleBinding`and `ClusterRoleBinding` with the standard RBAC controls: get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete.

| Multi-cluster management       | Management and managed clusters in single management plane.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Predefined roles and permissions

{{prodname}} provides the following predefined roles and permissions:

`tigera-ui-user`

- Basic user with access to {{prodname}} Manager UI and Kibana:
  - List/view Calico Enterprise policy and tier resources in the `projectcalico.org` and `networking.k8s.io` API groups
  - List/view logs in Kibana

`tigera-network-admin`

- Superuser access for Kibana (including Elastic user and license management), and all Calico resources in `projectcalico.org` and `networking.k8s.io` API groups (get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete)

`mcm-user`

- Admin user with full permissions to management and managed clusters for multi-cluster management
