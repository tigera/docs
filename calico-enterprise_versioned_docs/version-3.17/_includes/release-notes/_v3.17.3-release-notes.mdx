### Improvements
- We've added support for MKE 3.7.1

### Bug fixes
- TCP stats not working in iptables mode
- Egress gateway connection issue

### Known issues {#known-issues-3.17.3}
- The canvas on Service Graph may zoom and pan unexpectedly when modifying Views or Layers
- Dragging tiers to modify their order is currently not working in the UI, though you can still change its order when editing a tier
- Policy recommendations may generate rules with ports and protocols for intra-namespace traffic. This will be modified in the next patch release to exclude ports and protocols and provide an option to Allow or Pass this traffic.
- Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.17.3 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed.
- Multi-cluster management of managed clusters with version before v3.17.0 is currently not working.
