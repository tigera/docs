### Improvements
- We've added support for MKE 3.7.1

### Bug fixes
- TCP stats not working in iptables mode
- Egress gateway connection issue

### Known issues {#known-issues-3.17.3}
- Kubernetes audit logs for EKS does not work and pods get stuck with this error: `eks-log-forwarder-startup time="2024-01-23T17:42:29Z" level=fatal msg="Error setting up elastic client.`
- The canvas on Service Graph may zoom and pan unexpectedly when modifying Views or Layers
- Dragging tiers to modify their order is currently not working in the UI, though you can still change its order when editing a tier
- Policy recommendations may generate rules with ports and protocols for intra-namespace traffic. This will be modified in the next patch release to exclude ports and protocols and provide an option to Allow or Pass this traffic.
- Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.17.3 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed.
- Multi-cluster management of managed clusters with version before v3.17.0 is currently not working.
- Calico panics if kube-proxy or other components are using native `nftables` rules instead of the `iptables-nft` compatibility shim. Until Calico supports native nftables mode, we recommend that you continue to use the iptables-nft compatibility layer for all components. (The compatibility layer was the only option before Kubernetes v1.29 added alpha-level `nftables` support.) Do not run Calico in "legacy" iptables mode on a system that is also using `nftables`. Although this combination does not panic or fail (at least on kernels that support both), the interaction between `iptables` "legacy" mode and `nftables` is confusing: both `iptables` and `nftables` rules can be executed on the same packet, leading to policy verdicts being "overturned". Note that this issue applies to all previous versions of {{prodname}}.
