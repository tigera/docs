Entity rules specify the attributes of the source or destination of a packet that must match for the rule as a whole
to match. Packets are matched on their IPs and ports. If the rule contains multiple match criteria (for example, an
IP and a port) then all match criteria must match for the rule as a whole to match.

[Selectors](#selector) offer a powerful way to select the source or destination to match based on labels.  
Selectors can match [workload endpoints](../../reference/resources/workloadendpoint.mdx), host endpoint and
([namespaced](../../reference/resources/networkset.mdx) or
[global](../../reference/resources/globalnetworkset.mdx)) network sets.

:::note

You cannot mix IPv4 and IPv6 CIDRs in a single rule using `nets` or `notNets`. If you need to match both, create 2 rules.

:::

### Exact and wildcard domain names

The `domains` field is only valid for egress Allow rules. It restricts the
rule to apply only to traffic to one of the specified domains. If this field is specified, the
parent [Rule](#rule)'s `action` must be `Allow`, and `nets` and `selector` must both be left empty.

<DomainNames />

:::note

{{prodname}} implements policy for domain names by learning the
corresponding IPs from DNS, then programming rules to allow those IPs. This means that
if multiple domain names A, B and C all map to the same IP, and there is domain-based
policy to allow A, traffic to B and C will be allowed as well.
