description: Install Calico Enterprise using Helm application package manager.

# Helm

## Big picture

Install {{prodname}} on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm 3.

## Value

Helm charts are a way to package up an application for Kubernetes (similar to `apt` or `yum` for operating systems). Helm is also used by tools like ArgoCD to manage applications in a cluster, taking care of install, upgrade (and rollback if needed), etc.

## Before you begin

**Required**

- Install Helm 3
- `kubeconfig` is configured to work with your cluster (check by running `kubectl get nodes`)
- [Credentials for the Tigera private registry and a license key](../calico-enterprise.mdx)

**Optional**

- If you bring your own Prometheus operator and omit the Tigera Prometheus operator from our Helm chart during installation, make sure that it is running before you install {{prodname}}.

**Not Supported**

- Multi-cluster management (mcm)

<!-- TODO(dimitrin) Add supported cluster type after verification

management and managed clusters -->

## Concepts

### Operator based installation

In this guide, you install the Tigera Calico operator and custom resource definitions using the Helm 3 chart. The Tigera operator provides lifecycle management for {{prodname}} exposed via the Kubernetes API defined as a custom resource definition.

## How to

### Download the Helm chart

## Next steps

**Multicluster Management**

- [Create a {{prodname}} management cluster](../../../multicluster/create-a-management-cluster.mdx)
- [Create a {{prodname}} managed cluster](../../../multicluster/create-a-managed-cluster.mdx)

**Recommended**

- [Configure access to {{prodname}} Manager UI](../../../operations/cnx/access-the-manager.mdx)
- [Authentication quickstart](../../../operations/cnx/authentication-quickstart.mdx)
- [Configure your own identity provider](../../../operations/cnx/configure-identity-provider.mdx)

**Recommended - Networking**

- The default networking is IP in IP encapsulation using BGP routing. For all networking options, see [Determine best networking option](../../../networking/determine-best-networking.mdx).

**Recommended - Security**

- [Get started with {{prodname}} tiered network policy](../../../network-policy/policy-tiers/tiered-policy.mdx)
