# System requirements

<ReqsSys orch='Kubernetes' />

## CNI plug-in enabled

{{prodname}} is installed as a CNI plugin. The kubelet must be configured
to use CNI networking by passing the `--network-plugin=cni` argument. (On
kubeadm, this is the default.)

## Other network providers

{{prodname}} must be the only network provider in each cluster. We do
not currently support migrating a cluster with another network provider to
use {{prodname}} networking.

## Supported kube-proxy modes

{{prodname}} supports the following kube-proxy modes:

- `iptables` (default)

### IP pool configuration

The IP range selected for pod IP addresses cannot overlap with any other
IP ranges in your network, including:

- The Kubernetes service cluster IP range
- The range from which host IPs are allocated
