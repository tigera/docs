# Install NodeLocal DNSCache

## Big picture

If you choose to use [NodeLocal DNSCache](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/nodelocaldns/) in your cluster,
follow these steps to enable connectivity for your components.

## Unsupported

- OpenShift

### OpenShift

Openshift has its own DNS caching mechanism which deploys CoreDNS pods as Daemonsets. NodeLocal DNSCache does not support
OpenShift.
Read more on the [Openshift DNS setup](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/networking/dns-operator.html).

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following Calico features:

- GlobalNetworkPolicies

## Before you begin...

**Required**

- {{prodname}} is installed
- [NodeLocal DNSCache](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/nodelocaldns/) deployed or ready to be
deployed to your cluster

## How to

Create a network policy to allow traffic from NodeLocal DNSCache to `kube-dns`. A broad network policy in the example
below will allow all incoming TCP traffic on port 53 on `kube-dns` which will include the incoming traffic from
`node-local-dns` pods, too.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default.local-dns-to-core-dns
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  tier: default
  selector: k8s-app == "kube-dns"
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      destination:
        selector: k8s-app == "kube-dns"
        ports:
          - '53'
  types:
    - Ingress
```


If you want to refine the sources allowed by this policy, note that NodeLocal DNSCache pods are host networked,
and ensure you allow traffic from the addresses of your hosts. If you're using encapsulation, you will need to allow
connectivity from the tunnel IPs.

The Tigera operator creates policy to allow Tigera components to connect to NodeLocal DNSCache when detected.
Felix accounts for the NodeLocal DNSCache in creating DNS Logs and enforcing DNS Policy.
