# Configure BGP peering

## Big picture

Configure BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) between Calico nodes or peering with network infrastructure to distribute routing information.

## Value

$[prodname] nodes can exchange routing information over BGP to enable reachability for $[prodname] networked workloads (Kubernetes pods or OpenStack VMs). In an on-premises deployment this allows you to make your workloads first-class citizens across the rest of your network. In public cloud deployments, it provides an efficient way of distributing routing information within your cluster, and is often used in conjunction with IPIP overlay or cross-subnet modes.

## Concepts

### BGP

**BGP** is a standard protocol for exchanging routing information between routers in a network. Each router running BGP has one or more **BGP peers** - other routers which they are communicating with over BGP. You can think of $[prodname] networking as providing a virtual router on each of your nodes. You can configure $[prodname] nodes to peer with each other, with route reflectors, or with top-of-rack (ToR) routers.

### Common BGP topologies

There are many ways to configure a BGP network depending on your environment. Here are some common ways it is done with $[prodname].

### Full-mesh

When BGP is enabled, $[prodname]’s default behavior is to create a **full-mesh** of internal BGP (iBGP) connections where each node peers with each other. This allows $[prodname] to operate over any L2 network, whether public cloud or private cloud, or, if IPIP is [configured](vxlan-ipip.mdx), to operate as an overlay over any network that does not block IPIP traffic. $[prodname] does not use BGP for VXLAN overlays.

:::note

Most public clouds support IPIP. The notable exception is Azure, which blocks IPIP traffic. So if you want to run Calico as an overlay network in Azure, you must [configure $[prodname] to use VXLAN](vxlan-ipip.mdx).

:::

Full-mesh works great for small and medium-size deployments of say 100 nodes or less, but at significantly larger scales full-mesh becomes less efficient, and we recommend using route reflectors.

### Route reflectors

To build large clusters of internal BGP (iBGP), **BGP route reflectors** can be used to reduce the number of BGP peerings used on each node. In this model, some nodes act as route reflectors and are configured to establish a full mesh amongst themselves. Other nodes are then configured to peer with a subset of those route reflectors (typically 2 for redundancy), reducing the total number BGP peering connections compared to full-mesh.

### Top of Rack (ToR)

In **on-premises deployments**, you can configure $[prodname] to peer directly with your physical network infrastructure. Typically, this involves disabling $[prodname]’s default full-mesh behavior, and instead peer $[prodname] with your L3 ToR routers. There are many ways to build an on-premises BGP network. How you configure your BGP is up to you - $[prodname] works well with both iBGP and eBGP configurations, and you can effectively treat $[prodname] like any other router in your network design.

Depending on your topology, you may also consider using BGP route reflectors within each rack. However, this is typically needed only if the number of nodes in each L2 domain is large (> 100).

For a deeper look at common on-premises deployment models, see [Calico over IP Fabrics](../../reference/architecture/design/l2-interconnect-fabric.mdx).

Significantly changing $[prodname]'s BGP topology, such as changing from full-mesh to peering with ToRs, may result in temporary loss of pod network connectivity during the reconfiguration process. It is recommended to only make such changes during a maintenance window.

### Configure a global BGP peer

Global BGP peers apply to all nodes in your cluster. This is useful if your network topology includes BGP speakers that will be peered with every $[prodname] node in your deployment.

The following example creates a global BGP peer that configures every $[prodname] node to peer with **192.20.30.40** in AS **64567**.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: my-global-peer
spec:
  peerIP: 192.20.30.40
  asNumber: 64567
```

### Configure a per-node BGP peer

Per-node BGP peers apply to one or more nodes in the cluster. You can choose which nodes by specifying the node’s name exactly, or using a label selector.

The following example creates a BGPPeer that configures every $[prodname] node with the label, **rack: rack-1** to peer with **192.20.30.40** in AS **64567**.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: rack1-tor
spec:
  peerIP: 192.20.30.40
  asNumber: 64567
  nodeSelector: rack == 'rack-1'
```

### Configure a node to act as a route reflector

$[prodname] nodes can be configured to act as route reflectors. To do this, each node that you want to act as a route reflector must have a cluster ID - typically an unused IPv4 address.

To configure a node to be a route reflector with cluster ID 244.0.0.1, run the following command.

```bash
kubectl annotate node my-node projectcalico.org/RouteReflectorClusterID=244.0.0.1
```

Typically, you will want to label this node to indicate that it is a route reflector, allowing it to be easily selected by a BGPPeer resource. You can do this with kubectl. For example:

```bash
kubectl label node my-node route-reflector=true
```

Now it is easy to configure route reflector nodes to peer with each other and other non-route-reflector nodes using label selectors. For example:

```yaml
kind: BGPPeer
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
metadata:
  name: peer-with-route-reflectors
spec:
  nodeSelector: all()
  peerSelector: route-reflector == 'true'
```

:::note

Adding `routeReflectorClusterID` to a node spec will remove it from the node-to-node mesh immediately, tearing down the
existing BGP sessions. Adding the BGP peering will bring up new BGP sessions. This will cause a short (about 2 seconds)
disruption to data plane traffic of workloads running in the nodes where this happens. To avoid this, make sure no
workloads are running on the nodes, by provisioning new nodes or by running `kubectl drain` on the node (which may
itself cause a disruption as workloads are drained).

:::

### Disable the default BGP node-to-node mesh

The default **node-to-node BGP mesh** may be turned off to enable other BGP topologies. To do this, modify the default **BGP configuration** resource.

Run the following command to disable the BGP full-mesh:

```bash
calicoctl patch bgpconfiguration default -p '{"spec": {"nodeToNodeMeshEnabled": false}}'
```

:::note

If the default BGP configuration resource does not exist, you need to create it first. See [BGP configuration](../../reference/resources/bgpconfig.mdx) for more information.

:::

:::note

Disabling the node-to-node mesh will break pod networking until/unless you configure replacement BGP peerings using BGPPeer resources.
You may configure the BGPPeer resources before disabling the node-to-node mesh to avoid pod networking breakage.

:::

### Change from node-to-node mesh to route reflectors without any traffic disruption

Switching from node-to-node BGP mesh to BGP route reflectors involves tearing down BGP sessions and bringing up new ones. This causes a short
dataplane network disruption (of about 2 seconds) for workloads running on the nodes in the cluster. To avoid this, you may provision
route reflector nodes and bring their BGP sessions up before tearing down the node-to-node mesh sessions.

Follow these steps to do so:

1. [Provision new nodes to be route reflectors.](#configure-a-node-to-act-as-a-route-reflector) The nodes [should not be schedulable](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/)
   and they should have `routeReflectorClusterID` in their spec. These won't be part of the existing
   node-to-node BGP mesh, and will be the route reflectors when the mesh is disabled. These nodes should also have a label like
   `route-reflector` to select them for the BGP peerings. [Alternatively](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/),
   you can drain workloads from existing nodes in your cluster by running `kubectl drain <NODE>` to configure them to be route reflectors,
   but this will cause a disruption on the workloads on those nodes as they are drained.

2. Also set up a [BGPPeer](#configure-a-node-to-act-as-a-route-reflector) spec to configure route reflector nodes to peer with each other and other non-route-reflector nodes
   using label selectors.

3. Wait for these peerings to be established. This can be [verified](#view-bgp-peering-status-for-a-node) by running `sudo calicoctl node status` on the nodes. Alternatively, you can create a [`CalicoNodeStatus` resource](../../reference/resources/caliconodestatus.mdx) to get BGP session status for the node.

4. [Disable the BGP node-to-node mesh for the cluster.](#disable-the-default-bgp-node-to-node-mesh)

5. If you did drain workloads from the nodes or created them as unschedulable, mark the nodes as schedulable again (e.g. by running `kubectl uncordon <NODE>`).

### View BGP peering status for a node

Create a [CalicoNodeStatus resource](../../reference/resources/caliconodestatus.mdx) to monitor BGP session status for the node.

Alternatively, you can run the `calicoctl node status` command on a given node to learn more about its BGP status.

:::note

This command communicates with the local $[prodname] agent, so you must execute it on the node whose status you are attempting to view.

:::

### View BGP info on all peers for a node

You can use `calicoctl` to view the BGP information for all peers of a particular node, including connection status, routing statistics, and BGP state. This is useful for confirming that your configuration is behaving as desired, and for more detailed troubleshooting.

Run the following command from anywhere you have access to `kubectl`:

```bash
calicoctl bgp peers <NODE_NAME>
```

Where `<NODE_NAME>` is the resource name for one of the Calico node pods within your cluster.

:::note

The above command can be run from anywhere you have access to kubectl. We recommend running it as a kubectl plugin. [Follow these instructions](../../operations/clis/calicoctl/install.mdx#install-calicoctl-as-a-kubectl-plugin-on-a-single-host) for how to install `calicoctl` as a kubectl plugin.

:::
If you install the binary as a kubectl plugin using the above instructions, you can then run the command as follows:

```bash
kubectl calico bgp peers <NODE_NAME>
```

### Change the default global AS number

By default, all Calico nodes use the 64512 autonomous system, unless a per-node AS has been specified for the node. You can change the global default for all nodes by modifying the default **BGPConfiguration** resource. The following example command sets the global default AS number to **64513**.

```bash
kubectl patch bgpconfiguration default -p '{"spec": {"asNumber": "64513"}}'
```

:::note

If the default BGP configuration resource does not exist, you need to create it first. See [BGP configuration](../../reference/resources/bgpconfig.mdx) for more information.

:::

### Change AS number for a particular node

You can configure an AS for a particular node by modifying the node object using `calicoctl`. For example, the following command changes the node named **node-1** to belong to **AS 64514**.

```bash
calicoctl patch node node-1 -p '{"spec": {"bgp": {"asNumber": "64514"}}}'
```

### Configure a BGP filter

BGP filters control which routes are imported and exported between BGP peers.

The BGP filter rules (importVX, exportVX) are applied sequentially, taking the
`action` of the first matching rule. When no rules are matched, the default
`action` is `Accept`.

In order for a BGPFilter to be used in a BGP peering, its `name`
must be added to `filters` of the corresponding BGPPeer resource.

The following example creates a BGPFilter

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: BGPFilter
metadata:
  name: my-filter
spec:
  exportV4:
    - action: Accept
      matchOperator: In
      cidr: 77.0.0.0/16
    - action: Reject
      source: RemotePeers
    - action: Reject
  importV4:
    - action: Reject
      matchOperator: NotIn
      cidr: 44.0.0.0/16
  exportV6:
    - action: Reject
      source: RemotePeers
    - action: Reject
  importV6:
    - action: Accept
      matchOperator: Equal
      cidr: 5000::0/64
    - action: Reject
```

### Configure a BGP peer with a BGP filter

BGP peers can use BGP filters to control which routes are imported or exported between them.

The following example creates a BGPFilter and associates it with a BGPPeer
:::note

BGPFilters are applied in the order listed on a BGPPeer

:::

```yaml
kind: BGPFilter
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
metadata:
  name: first-bgp-filter
spec:
  exportV4:
    - action: Accept
      matchOperator: In
      cidr: 77.0.0.0/16
      source: RemotePeers
  importV4:
    - action: Reject
      matchOperator: NotIn
      cidr: 44.0.0.0/16
  exportV6:
    - action: Reject
  importV6:
    - action: Accept
      matchOperator: Equal
      cidr: 5000::0/64

    - action: Reject
      matchOperator: NotIn
      cidr: 44.0.0.0/16
