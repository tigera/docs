# Deploy a dual ToR cluster

## Big picture

Deploy a dual plane cluster to provide redundant connectivity between your workloads for on-premises deployments.

:::note

Dual ToR is not supported if you are using BGP with encapsulation (VXLAN or IP-in-IP).

:::

## Value

A dual plane cluster provides two independent planes of connectivity between all cluster
nodes. If a link or software component breaks somewhere in one of those planes, cluster
nodes can still communicate over the other plane, and the cluster as a whole continues to
operate normally.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following features:

**{{nodecontainer}}** run as a container, pre-Kubernetes

**BGPPeer** resource with these fields:

- sourceAddress
- failureDetectionMode
- restartMode
- maxRestartTime
- birdGatewayMode

## Concepts

### Dual plane connectivity, aka "dual ToR"

Large on-prem Kubernetes clusters, split across multiple server racks, can use two or more
independent planes of connectivity between all the racks. The advantages are:

- The cluster can still function, even if there is a single break in connectivity
  somewhere.

- The cluster can load balance across the bandwidth of _both_ planes, when both planes
  are available.

The redundant approach can be applied within each rack as well, such that each node has
two or more independent connections to those connectivity planes. Typically, each rack
has two top-of-rack routers ("ToRs") and each node has two fabric-facing interfaces, each
of which connects over a separate link or Ethernet to one of the ToRs for the rack.

Here's an example of how a dual plane setup might look, with just two racks and two nodes
in each rack. For simplicity, we've shown the connections _between_ racks as single
links; in reality that would be more complex, but still following the overall dual plane
paradigm.

![dual-tor](/img/calico-enterprise/dual-tor.png)

Because of the two ToRs per rack, the whole setup is often referred to as "dual ToR".

### Network design for a dual ToR cluster

For a dual ToR cluster to operate seamlessly when there is a break on one of the planes,
several things are needed.

- Each node should have a stable IP address that is independent of its per-interface
  addresses and remains valid if the connectivity through _one_ of those interfaces goes
  down.

- Each node must somehow know or learn the stable IP address of every other node.

- Wherever a connection (other than BGP) is to or from a _node_ (as opposed to a
  non-host-networked pod), that connection should use the node's stable address as its
  destination or source IP (respectively), so that the connection can continue working if
  one of the planes has an outage.

- Importantly, this includes connections that Kubernetes uses as part of its own control
  plane, such as between the Kubernetes API server and kubelet on each node. Ideally,
  therefore, the stable IP address setup on each node should happen before Kubernetes
  starts running.

- BGP is an exception to the previous points - in fact, the _only_ exception - because we
  want each node's BGP peerings to be interface-specific and to reflect what is actually
  reachable, moment by moment, over that interface. The Linux routing table then
  automatically adjusts so that the route to each remote destination is either ECMP -
  when both planes are up - or non-ECMP when it can only be reached over one of the
  planes.

- BGP peerings should be configured to detect any outages, and to propagate their
  consequences, as quickly as possible, so that the routing can quickly respond on each
  node. Note that this is quite different from the reasoning for a single connectivity
  plane, where it's better to delay any network churn, on the assumption that an outage
  will be quickly fixed.

Finally, to spread load evenly and maximise use of both planes, when both available, the
routers and Linux kernel need to be configured for efficient ECMP.

### Calico's early networking architecture

{{prodname}}'s {{nodecontainer}} image can be run in an "early networking" mode,
on each node, to perform all of the above points that are needed before Kubernetes starts
running. That means that it:

- Provisions the stable IP address.

- Makes the changes needed to ensure that the stable address will be used as the source
  IP for any outgoing connections from the node.

- Starts running BGP, peering with the node's ToRs, in order to advertise the node's
  stable address to other nodes.

- Configures efficient ECMP in the Linux kernel (with `fib_multipath_hash_policy=1` and
  `fib_multipath_use_neigh=1`).

More detail is given below on how to run this early networking image. A key point is that
it must run as soon as possible after each node boot, and before Kubernetes starts on the
node, so it is typically run as a Docker or podman container.

After its start-of-day provisioning, the early networking container keeps running so that
it can tag-team the BGP role with Calico's regular BGP service running inside the
{{nodecontainer}} _pod_:

- Initially the {{nodecontainer}} pod does not yet exist, so the early networking
  BGP runs to advertise out the node's stable address.

- After Kubernetes has started on the node, and Calico has been installed in Kubernetes,
  the {{nodecontainer}} pod runs and starts its own BGP service. The early
  networking container spots that the regular BGP service is now running and so shuts
  down its own BGP. Now the regular BGP service handles the advertisement of the stable
  address, as well as pod IPs and so on.

- Later, the {{nodecontainer}} pod might be shut down, e.g. for restart or upgrade.
  If the downtime continues for longer than the graceful restart period, the early
  networking container spots this and restarts its own BGP, to ensure that the node's
  stable IP address continues to be advertised to other nodes. The cycle can now repeat
  from the "Initially" state above.

  :::note

  The default graceful restart period is 120s for traditional BGP GR and
  3600s for LLGR.

  :::

### BGP configuration for rapid outage detection

A dual ToR cluster needs Calico BGPPeer resources to specify how each node should peer
with its ToRs. The remaining parts of the dual ToR network design are implemented as
properties of those BGP peerings, and as corresponding properties on the BGP configuration
between and within the ToRs and core infrastructure.

Specifically, on Calico's BGPPeer resource,

- the `failureDetectionMode` field is used to enable BFD

- the `restartMode` field can be used to enable long-lived graceful restart (LLGR).

See below for more on the benefits of these settings. When they are used, consistent
settings are needed on the ToRs and core infrastructure.

### ECMP routing

An "Equal Cost Multiple Path" (ECMP) route is one that has multiple possible ways to reach
a given destination or prefix, all of which are considered to be equally good. A dual ToR
setup naturally generates ECMP routes, with the different paths going over the different
connectivity planes.

When using an ECMP route, Linux decides how to balance traffic across the available paths,
including whether this is informed by TCP and UDP port numbers as well as source and
destination IP addresses, whether the decision is made per-packet, per-connection, or in
some other way, and so on; and the details here have varied with Linux kernel version.
For a clear account of the exact options and behaviors for different kernel versions,
please see [this blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20210204031636/https://cumulusnetworks.com/blog/celebrating-ecmp-part-two/).

### BFD

Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is [a
protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5880) that detects very quickly when forwarding
along a particular path stops working - whether that's because a link has broken
somewhere, or some software component along the path.

In a dual ToR setup, rapid failure detection is important so that traffic flows within the
cluster can quickly adjust to using the other available connectivity plane.

### Long lived graceful restart

Long Lived Graceful Restart (LLGR) is [an extension for
BGP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-uttaro-idr-bgp-persistence-05) that handles link
failure by lowering the preference of routes over that link. This is a compromise between
the base BGP behaviour - which is immediately to remove those routes - and traditional BGP
Graceful Restart behaviour - which is not to change those routes at all, until some
configured time has passed.

For a dual ToR setup, LLGR is helpful, as explained in more detail by [this
blog](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2018-bgp-llgr), because:

- If a link fails somewhere, the immediate preference lowering allows traffic to adjust
  immediately to use the other connectivity plane.

- If a node is restarted, we still get the traditional Graceful Restart behaviour whereby
  routes to that node persist in the rest of the network.

### Default routing and "nearly default" routes

Calico's early networking architecture - and more generally, the considerations for dual
ToR that are presented on this page - is compatible with many possible [L3 fabric
designs](../../reference/architecture/design/l3-interconnect-fabric.mdx). One of
the options in such designs is "downward default", which means that each ToR only
advertises the default route to its directly connected nodes, even when it has much more
detailed routing information. "Downward default" works because the ToR should indeed be
the node's next hop for all destinations, except for directly connected nodes in the same
rack.

In a dual ToR cluster, each node has two ToRs, and "downward default" should result in the
node having an ECMP default route like this:

```
default proto bird
        nexthop via 172.31.11.100 dev eth0
        nexthop via 172.31.12.100 dev eth0
```

If one of the planes is broken, BGP detects and propagates the outage and that route
automatically changes to a non-ECMP route via the working plane:

```
default via 172.31.12.100 dev eth0 proto bird
```

That is exactly the behaviour that is wanted in a dual ToR cluster. The snag with it is
that there can be other procedures in the node's operating system that also update the
default route - in particular, DHCP - and that can interfere with this desired behaviour.
For example, if a DHCP lease renewal occurs for one of the node's interfaces, the node may
then replace the default route as non-ECMP via that interface.

A simple way to avoid such interference is to export the "nearly default" routes 0.0.0.0/1
and 128.0.0.0/1 from the ToRs, instead of the true default route 0.0.0.0/0. 0.0.0.0/1 and
128.0.0.0/1 together cover the entire IPv4 address space and so provide correct dual ToR
routing for any destination outside the local rack. They also mask the true default route
0.0.0.0/0, by virtue of having longer prefixes (1 bit instead of 0 bits), and so it no
longer matters if there is any other programming of the true default route on the node.

## How to

- [Prepare YAML resources describing the layout of your cluster](#prepare-yaml-resources-describing-the-layout-of-your-cluster)
- [Arrange for dual-homed nodes to run {{nodecontainer}} on each boot](#arrange-for-dual-homed-nodes-to-run-cnx-node-on-each-boot)

- [Install Kubernetes and {{prodname}}](#install-kubernetes-and-calico-enterprise)
- [Verify the deployment](#verify-the-deployment)

### Prepare YAML resources describing the layout of your cluster

1.  Prepare BGPPeer resources to specify how each node in your cluster should peer with
    the ToR routers in its rack. For example, if your rack 'A' has ToRs with IPs
    172.31.11.100 and 172.31.12.100 and the rack AS number is 65001:

    ```yaml noValidation
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: BGPPeer
    metadata:
      name: ra1
    spec:
      nodeSelector: "rack == 'ra' || rack == 'ra_single'"
      peerIP: 172.31.11.100
      asNumber: 65001
      sourceAddress: None
    ---
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: BGPPeer
    metadata:
      name: ra2
    spec:
      nodeSelector: "rack == 'ra'"
      peerIP: 172.31.12.100
      asNumber: 65001
      sourceAddress: None
    EOF
    ```

    :::note

    The effect of the `nodeSelector` fields here is that any node with label
    `rack: ra` will peer with both these ToRs, while any node with label `rack: ra_single` will peer with only the first ToR. For optimal dual ToR function and
    resilience, nodes in rack 'A' should be labelled `rack: ra`, but `rack: ra_single`
    can be used instead on any nodes which cannot be dual-homed.

    :::

    Repeat for as many racks as there are in your cluster. Each rack needs a new pair of
    BGPPeer resources with its own ToR addresses and AS number, and `nodeSelector` fields
    matching the nodes that should peer with its ToR routers.

    Depending on what your ToR supports, consider also setting these fields in each
    BGPPeer:

    - `failureDetectionMode: BFDIfDirectlyConnected` to enable BFD, when possible, for
      fast failure detection.

      :::note

      {{prodname}} only supports BFD on directly connected peerings, but
      in practice nodes are normally directly connected to their ToRs.

      :::

    - `restartMode: LongLivedGracefulRestart` to enable LLGR handling when the node needs
      to be restarted, if your ToR routers support LLGR. If not, we recommend instead
      `maxRestartTime: 10s`.

    - `birdGatewayMode: DirectIfDirectlyConnected` to enable the "direct" next hop
      algorithm, if that is helpful for optimal interworking with your ToR routers.

      :::note

      For directly connected BGP peerings, BIRD provides two gateway
      computation modes, ["direct" and
      "recursive"](https://bird.network.cz/?get_doc&v=16&f=bird-6.html#ss6.3).
      "recursive" is the default, but "direct" can give better results when the ToR
      also acts as the route reflector (RR) for the rack.
      Specifically, a combined ToR/RR should ideally keep the BGP next hop intact (aka
      "next hop keep") when reflecting routes from other nodes in the same rack, but
      add itself as the BGP next hop (aka "next hop self") when forwarding routes from
      outside the rack. If your ToRs can be configured to do that, fine.
      If they cannot, an effective workaround is to configure the ToRs to do "next hop
      keep" for all routes, with "gateway direct" on the {{prodname}} nodes. In
      effect the “gateway direct” applies a “next hop self” when needed, but otherwise
      not.

      :::

1.  Prepare this BGPConfiguration resource to [disable the full node-to-node
    mesh](bgp.mdx#disable-the-default-bgp-node-to-node-mesh):

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: BGPConfiguration
    metadata:
      name: default
    spec:
      nodeToNodeMeshEnabled: false
    ```

1.  Prepare disabled IPPool resources for the CIDRs from which you will allocate stable
    addresses for dual-homed nodes. For example, if the nodes in rack 'A' will have
    stable addresses from 172.31.10.0/24:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: IPPool
    metadata:
      name: ra-stable
    spec:
      cidr: 172.31.10.0/24
      disabled: true
      nodeSelector: all()
    ```

    If the next rack uses a different CIDR, define a similar IPPool for that rack, and so
    on.

    :::note

    These IPPool definitions tell {{prodname}}'s BGP component to export
    routes within the given CIDRs, which is essential for the core BGP infrastructure to
    learn how to route to each stable address. `disabled: true` tells {{prodname}}
    _not_ to use these CIDRs for pod IPs.

    :::

1.  Prepare an enabled IPPool resource for your default CIDR for pod IPs. For example:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: IPPool
    metadata:
      name: default-ipv4
    spec:
      cidr: 10.244.0.0/16
      nodeSelector: all()
    ```

    :::note

    The CIDR must match what you specify elsewhere in the Kubernetes
    installation. For example, `networking.clusterNetwork.cidr` in OpenShift's install
    config, or `--pod-network-cidr` with kubeadm. You should not specify `ipipMode` or
    `vxlanMode`, as these are incompatible with dual ToR operation. `natOutgoing` can
    be omitted, as here, if your core infrastructure will perform an SNAT for traffic
    from pods to the Internet.

    :::

1.  Prepare an EarlyNetworkConfiguration resource to specify the additional information
    that is needed for each node in a multi-rack dual ToR cluster:

    - The stable address for the node.
    - Its BGP AS number.
    - The IPs that the node should peer with, when {{nodecontainer}} runs
      as a container for early networking setup after each node boot.
    - Any labels that the node should have, so as to match the right BGPPeer definitions
      for its rack, when {{nodecontainer}} runs as a Kubernetes pod.

    <br />
    With OpenShift, also add a toplevel `platform: openshift` setting.

    :::note

    `platform: openshift` triggers additional per-node setup that is needed
    during OpenShift's bootstrapping phase.

    :::

    For example, with IP addresses and AS numbers similar as for other resources above:

    ```yaml noValidation
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: EarlyNetworkConfiguration
    spec:
      platform: openshift
      nodes:
         # worker1
        - interfaceAddresses:
            - 172.31.11.3
            - 172.31.12.3
          stableAddress:
            address: 172.31.10.3
          asNumber: 65001
          peerings:
            - peerIP: 172.31.11.100
            - peerIP: 172.31.12.100
          labels:
            rack: ra
         # worker2
        - interfaceAddresses:
            - 172.31.21.4
            - 172.31.22.4
          stableAddress:
            address: 172.31.20.4
          asNumber: 65002
          peerings:
            - peerIP: 172.31.21.100
            - peerIP: 172.31.22.100
          labels:
            rack: rb
        ...
    ```

1.  Prepare a ConfigMap resource named "bgp-layout", in namespace "tigera-operator", that
    wraps the EarlyNetworkConfiguration like this:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: bgp-layout
      namespace: calico-system
    data:
      earlyNetworkConfiguration: |
        apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
        kind: EarlyNetworkConfiguration
        spec:
          nodes:
            # worker1
            - interfaceAddresses:
        ...
    ```

:::note

EarlyNetworkingConfiguration supplies labels and AS numbers to apply to each
Calico node, as well as peering and other network configuration to use during node
startup prior to receiving BGPPeer and BGPConfiguration resources from the datastore.
EarlyNetworkingConfiguration will be superseded by any BGPPeer or BGPConfiguration
resources after successful startup.

:::

### Arrange for dual-homed nodes to run {{nodecontainer}} on each boot

{{prodname}}'s {{nodecontainer}} image normally runs as a Kubernetes pod, but
for dual ToR setup it must also run as a container after each boot of a dual-homed node.
For example:

```
podman run --privileged --net=host \
    -v /calico-early:/calico-early -e CALICO_EARLY_NETWORKING=/calico-early/cfg.yaml \
    {{registry}}{{imageNames.node}}:latest
```

The environment variable `CALICO_EARLY_NETWORKING` must point to the
EarlyNetworkConfiguration prepared above, so that EarlyNetworkConfiguration YAML must be
copied into a file on the node (here, `/calico-early/cfg.yaml`) and mapped into the
{{nodecontainer}} container.

We recommend defining systemd services to ensure that early networking runs on each boot,
and before kubelet starts on the node. Following is an example that may need tweaking for
your particular platform, but that illustrates the important points.

Firstly, a "calico-early" service that runs the Calico early networking on each boot:

```
[Unit]
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
After=nodeip-configuration.service
[Service]
ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c "rm -f /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/20-nodenet.conf /etc/systemd/system/crio.service.d/20-nodenet.conf; systemctl daemon-reload"
ExecStartPre=-/bin/podman rm -f calico-early
ExecStartPre=/bin/mkdir -p /etc/calico-early
ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c "test -f /etc/calico-early/details.yaml || /bin/curl -o /etc/calico-early/details.yaml http://172.31.1.1:8080/calico-early/details.yaml"
ExecStart=/bin/podman run --rm --privileged --net=host --name=calico-early -v /etc/calico-early:/etc/calico-early -e CALICO_EARLY_NETWORKING=/etc/calico-early/details.yaml {{registry}}{{imageNames.node}}:latest
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

:::note

- You must also install your Tigera-issued pull secret at `/root/.docker/config.json`,
  on each node, to enable pulling from {{registry}}.
- Some OpenShift versions have a `nodeip-configuration` service that configures
  kubelet's `--node-ip` option **wrongly** for a dual ToR setup. The
  `After=nodeip-configuration.service` setting and the deletion of `20-nodenet.conf`
  undo that service's work so that kubelet can choose its own IP correctly (using a
  reverse DNS lookup).
- The `/bin/curl ...` line shows how you can download the EarlyNetworkConfiguration
  YAML from a central hosting point within your cluster.

:::

Secondly, a "calico-early-wait" service that delays kubelet until after the Calico early
networking setup is in place:

```
[Unit]
After=calico-early.service
Before=kubelet.service
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "while sleep 5; do grep -q 00000000:1FF3 /proc/net/tcp && break; done; sleep 15"
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

:::note

- The `ExecStart` line here arranges that kubelet will not start running until the
  calico-early service has started listening on port 8179 (hex `1FF3`). 8179 is the
  port that the calico-early service uses for pre-Kubernetes BGP.
- We have sometimes observed issues if kubelet starts immediately after Calico's early
  networking setup, because of NetworkManager toggling the hostname. The final `sleep 15` allows for such changes to settle down before kubelet starts.

:::

On OpenShift you should wrap the above service definitions in `MachineConfig` resources
for the control and worker nodes.

On other platforms either define and enable the above services directly, or use
whatever API the platform provides to define and enable services on new nodes.

### Configure your ToR routers and infrastructure

You should configure your ToR routers to accept all the BGP peerings from
{{prodname}} nodes, to reflect routes between the nodes in that rack, and to
propagate routes between the ToR routers in different racks. In addition we recommend
consideration of the following points.

BFD should be enabled if possible on all BGP sessions - both to the {{prodname}}
nodes, and between racks in your core infrastructure - so that a break in connectivity
anywhere can be rapidly detected. The handling should be to initiate LLGR procedures if
possible, or else terminate the BGP session non-gracefully.

LLGR should be enabled if possible on all BGP sessions - again, both to the
{{prodname}} nodes, and between racks in your core infrastructure. Traditional BGP
graceful restart should not be used, because this will delay the cluster's response to a
break in one of the connectivity planes.

### Install Kubernetes and {{prodname}}

Details here vary, depending on **when** your Kubernetes installer gives an opportunity
for you to define custom resources, but fundamentally what is needed here is to perform
the installation as usual, except that all of the Calico resources prepared above, except
the EarlyNetworkConfiguration, must be added into the datastore **before** the
{{nodecontainer}} pods start running on any node. We can illustrate this by looking
at two examples: with OpenShift, and when adding Calico to an existing Kubernetes cluster.

**OpenShift**

With OpenShift, follow [our documentation](../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/openshift/index.mdx) as
far as the option to [provide additional configuration](../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/openshift/installation.mdx).
Then use `kubectl create configmap ...`, as that documentation says, to combine the
prepared BGPPeer, BGPConfiguration and IPPool resources into a `calico-resources`
ConfigMap. Place the generated file in the manifests directory for the OpenShift install.

Also place the "bgp-layout" ConfigMap file in the manifests directory.

Now continue with the OpenShift install process, and it will take care of adding those
resources into the datastore as early as possible.

**Adding to an existing Kubernetes cluster**

Follow [our documentation](../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/kubernetes/generic-install.mdx) as
far as the option for installing any custom Calico resources. Then use `calicoctl`, as
that documentation says, to install the prepared BGPPeer, BGPConfiguration and IPPool
resources.

Also use `kubectl` to install the "bgp-layout" ConfigMap.

Now continue with the {{prodname}} install process, and you should observe each node
establishing BGP sessions with its ToRs.

### Verify the deployment

If you examine traffic and connections within the cluster - for example, using `ss` or
`tcpdump` - you should see that all connections use loopback IP addresses or pod CIDR IPs
as their source and destination. For example:

- The kubelet on each node connecting to the API server.

- The API server's connection to its backing etcd database, and peer connections between
  the etcd cluster members.

- Pod connections that involve an SNAT or MASQUERADE in the data path, as can be the case
  when connecting to a Service through a cluster IP or NodePort. At the point of the
  SNAT or MASQUERADE, a loopback IP address should be used.

- Direct connections between pod IPs on different nodes.

The only connections using interface-specific addresses should be BGP.

If you look at the Linux routing table on any cluster node, you should see ECMP routes
like this to the loopback address of every other node in other racks:

```
172.31.20.4/32
   nexthop via 172.31.11.250 dev eth0
   nexthop via 172.31.12.250 dev eth1
```

and like this to the loopback address of every other node in the same rack:

```
172.31.10.4/32
   nexthop dev eth0
   nexthop dev eth1
```

If you launch some pods in the cluster, you should see ECMP routes for the /26 IP blocks
for the nodes where those pods were scheduled, like this:

If you do something to break the connectivity between racks of one of the planes, you
should see, within only a few seconds, that the affected routes change to have a single
path only, via the plane that is still unbroken; for example:

```
172.31.20.4/32 via 172.31.12.250 dev eth1`
10.244.192.128/26 via 172.31.12.250 dev eth1
```

When the connectivity break is repaired, those routes should change to become ECMP again.
