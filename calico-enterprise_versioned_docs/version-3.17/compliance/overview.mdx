# Schedule and run compliance reports

## Big picture

Schedule and run compliance reports to assess Kubernetes workloads and environments for regulatory compliance.

## Value

Compliance tools that rely on periodic snapshots, do not provide accurate assessments of Kubernetes workloads against your compliance standards. {{prodname}} compliance dashboard and reports provide a complete inventory of regulated workloads, along with evidence of enforcement of network controls for these workloads. Additionally, audit reports are available to see changes to any network security controls.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{prodname}} features:

- Preconfigured **compliance reports** (Inventory, Network Access, Policy Audit) that are installed with {{prodname}}
- A **GlobalReport** resource to schedule and configure reports
- The **compliance dashboard** in Manager UI to view reports

## Concepts

### Compliance reports at a glance

Compliance report are based on archived flow logs and audit logs for all of your {{prodname}} resources, plus any audit logs you've configured for Kubernetes resources in the Kubernetes API server:

- Pods
- Host endpoints
- Service accounts
- Namespaces
- Kubernetes service endpoints
- Global network sets
- Calico and Kubernetes network policies
- Global network policies

Compliance reports provide the following high-level information:

- **Protection**

  - Endpoints explicitly protected using ingress or egress policy
  - Endpoints with Envoy enabled

- **Policies and services**

  - Policies and services associated with endpoints
  - Policy audit logs

- **Traffic**
  - Allowed ingress/egress traffic to/from namespaces
  - Allowed ingress/egress traffic to/from the internet

## Before you begin

**Unsupported**

- AKS
- GKE
- OpenShift
- TKG

**Required**

- Ensure that all nodes in your Kubernetes clusters are time-synchronized using NTP or similar (for accurate audit log timestamps)

- [Configure audit logs for Kubernetes resources](../visibility/elastic/audit-overview.mdx)

  You must configure audit logs for Kubernetes resources through the Kubernetes API to get a complete view of all resources.

## How To

- [Configure report permissions](#configure-report-permissions)
- [Configure and schedule reports](#configure-and-schedule-reports)
- [View report generation status](#view-report-generation-status)
- [Run reports](#run-reports)

### Configure report permissions

Report permissions are granted using the standard Kubernetes RBAC based on ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBindings. The following table outlines the required RBAC verbs for each resource type for a specific user actions.

| **Action**                                              | **globalreporttypes**           | **globalreports**                 | **globalreports/status** |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Manage reports (create/modify/delete)                   |                                 | \*                                | get                      |
| View status of report generation through kubectl        |                                 | get                               | get                      |
| List the generated reports and summary status in the UI |                                 | list + get (for required reports) |                          |
| Export the generated reports from the UI                | get (for the particular report) | get (for required reports)        |                          |

The following sample manifest creates RBAC for three users: Paul, Candice and David.

- Paul has permissions to create/modify/delete the report schedules and configuration, but does not have permission to export generated reports from the UI.
- Candice has permissions to list and export generated reports from the UI, but cannot modify the report schedule or configuration.
- David has permissions to list and export generated `dev-inventory` reports from the UI, but cannot list or download other reports, nor modify the report
  schedule or configuration.

### Configure and schedule reports

To configure and schedule a compliance report, create a [GlobalReport](../reference/resources/globalreport.mdx) with the following information.

| **Fields**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name            | Unique name for your report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| reportType      | One of the following predefined report types: `inventory`, `network-access`, `policy-audit`.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| schedule        | The start and end time of the report using [crontab format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). To allow for archiving, reports are generated approximately 30 minutes after the end time. A single report is limited to a maximum of two per hour.                                           |
| endpoints       | **Optional**. For inventory and network-access reports, specifies the endpoints to include in the report. For the policy-audit report, restricts audit logs to include only policies that apply to the selected endpoints. If not specified, the report includes all endpoints and audit logs. |
| jobNodeSelector | **Optional**. Limits report generation jobs to specific nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| suspend         | **Optional**. Suspends report generation. All in-flight reports will complete, and future scheduled reports are suspended.                                                                                                                                                                     |

:::note

GlobalReports can only be configured using kubectl (not calicoctl); and they cannot be edited in the Tigera
Secure EE Manager UI.

:::

The following sections provide sample schedules for the predefined reports.

### Weekly reports, all endpoints

The following report schedules weekly inventory reports for _all_ endpoints. The jobs that create the reports will run
on the infrastructure nodes (e.g. nodetype == 'infrastructure').

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata:
  name: weekly-full-inventory
spec:
  reportType: inventory
  schedule: 0 0 * * 0
  jobNodeSelector:
    nodetype: infrastructure
```

### Daily reports, selected endpoints

The following report schedules daily inventory reports for production endpoints (e.g. deployment == ‘production’).

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata:
  name: daily-production-inventory
spec:
  reportType: inventory
  endpoints:
    selector: deployment == 'production'
  schedule: 0 0 * * *
```

### Hourly reports, endpoints in named namespaces

The following report schedules hourly network-access reports for the accounts department endpoints, that are
specified using the namespace names: **payable**, **collections** and **payroll**.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata:
  name: hourly-accounts-networkaccess
spec:
  reportType: network-access
  endpoints:
    namespaces:
      names: ['payable', 'collections', 'payroll']
  schedule: 0 * * * *
```

### Daily reports, endpoints in selected namespaces

The following report schedules daily network-access reports for the accounts department with endpoints specified using
a namespace selector.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata:
  name: daily-accounts-networkaccess
spec:
  reportType: network-access
  endpoints:
    namespaces:
      selector: department == 'accounts'
  schedule: 0 0 * * *
```

### Monthly reports, endpoints for named service accounts in named namespaces

The following schedules monthly audit reports. The audited policy is restricted to policy that applies to
widgets/controller endpoints specified by the namespace **widgets** and service account **controller**.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata:
  name: monthly-widgets-controller-tigera-policy-audit
spec:
  reportType: policy-audit
  schedule: 0 0 1 * *
  endpoints:
    serviceAccounts:
      names: ['controller']
    namespaces:
      names: ['widgets']
```

### View report generation status

To view the status of a report, you must use the `kubectl` command. For example:

```bash
kubectl get globalreports.projectcalico.org daily-inventory.p -o yaml
```

In a report, the job status types are:

- **lastScheduledReportJob**:
  The most recently scheduled job for generating the report. Because reports are scheduled in order, the “end time” of
  this report will be the “start time” of the next scheduled report.
- **activeReportJobs**:
  Default = allows up to 5 concurrent report generation jobs.
- **lastFailedReportJobs**:
  Default = keeps the 3 most recent failed jobs and deletes older ones. A single report generation job will be retried
  up to 6 times (by default) before it is marked as failed.
- **lastSuccessfulReportJobs**:
  Default = keeps the 2 most recent successful jobs and deletes older ones.

### Change the default report generation time

By default, reports are generated 30 minutes after the end of the report, to ensure all of the audit data is archived.
(However, this gap does not affect the data collected “start/end time” for a report.)

You can adjust the time for audit data for cases like initial report testing, to demo a report, or when manually
creating a report that is not counted in global report status.

To change the delay, go to the installation manifest, and uncomment and set the environment
`TIGERA_COMPLIANCE_JOB_START_DELAY`. Specify value as a [Duration string][parse-duration].

### Run reports

You can run reports at any time to specify a different start/end time, and if a scheduled report fails.

{{prodname}} GlobalReport schedules Kubernetes Jobs, which create a single-run pod to generate a report and store it
in Elasticsearch. Because you need to run reports as a pod, you need higher permissions: allow `create` access
access for pods in namespace `tigera-compliance` using the `tigera-compliance-reporter` service account.

To run a report on demand:

1. Download the pod template corresponding to your installation method.

   ```bash
   curl -O {{filesUrl}}/manifests/compliance-reporter-pod.yaml
   ```

1. Edit the template as follows:
   - Edit the pod name if required.
   - If you are using your own docker repository, update the container image name with your repo and image tag.
   - Set the following environments according to the instructions in the downloaded manifest:
     - `TIGERA_COMPLIANCE_REPORT_NAME`
     - `TIGERA_COMPLIANCE_REPORT_START_TIME`
     - `TIGERA_COMPLIANCE_REPORT_END_TIME`
1. Apply the updated manifest, and query the status of the pod to ensure it completes.
   Upon completion, the report is available in {{prodname}} Manager.

   ```bash
    # Apply the compliance report pod
   kubectl apply -f compliance-reporter-pod.yaml

    # Query the status of the pod
   kubectl get pod <podname> -n tigera-compliance
   ```

:::note

Manually-generated reports do not appear in GlobalReport status.
