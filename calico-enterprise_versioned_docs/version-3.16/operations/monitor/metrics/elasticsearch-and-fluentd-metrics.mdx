# Elasticsearch and Fluentd metrics

## Big picture

Use the Prometheus monitoring and alerting tool for Fluentd and Elasticsearch metrics to ensure continuous network visibility.

## Value

Platform engineering teams rely on logs, such as flow logs and DNS logs, for visibility into their networks. If collecting or storing logs are disrupted, this can impact network visibility. Prometheus can monitor log collection and storage metrics so platform engineering teams are alerted about problems before they occur.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{prodname}} features:

- **Fluentd**
- **Elasticsearch**

## Concepts

| Component     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Prometheus    | Monitoring tool that scrapes metrics from instrumented jobs and displays time series data in a visualizer (such as Grafana). For {{prodname}}, the “jobs” that Prometheus can harvest metrics from are the Elasticsearch and Fluentd components. |
| Elasticsearch | Stores {{prodname}} logs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Fluentd       | Sends {{prodname}} logs to Elasticsearch for storage.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

**Multi-cluster management users**: Elasticsearch metrics are collected only from the management cluster. Because managed clusters do not have Elasticsearch clusters, do not monitor Elasticsearch for managed clusters. However, managed clusters do feed Fluentd logs to Elasticsearch, so you should monitor fluentd for managed clusters.

### Create Prometheus alerts for Elasticsearch

The following example creates Prometheus rules to monitor some important Elasticsearch metrics, and alert when they have
crossed certain thresholds:

:::note

The Elasticsearch Prometheus rules are only applicable to standalone and management cluster types, not the
managed cluster type.

:::

:::note

The ElasticsearchHighMemoryUsage alert is an absolute value. This must be configured before applying the
rules.

### Create Prometheus alerts for Fluentd

The following example creates a Prometheus a rule to monitor some important Fluentd metrics, and alert when they
have crossed certain thresholds:

```yaml noValidation
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: tigera-prometheus-log-collection-monitoring
  namespace: tigera-prometheus
  labels:
    role: tigera-prometheus-rules
    prometheus: calico-node-prometheus
spec:
  groups:
  - name: tigera-log-collection.rules
    rules:
    - alert: FluentdPodConsistentlyLowBufferSpace
      expr: avg_over_time(fluentd_output_status_buffer_available_space_ratio[5m]) < 75
      labels:
        severity: Warning
      annotations:
        summary: "Fluentd pod {{$labels.pod}}'s buffer space is consistently below 75 percent capacity."
        description: "Fluentd pod {{$labels.pod}} has very low buffer space. There may be connection issues between Elasticsearch
and Fluentd or there are too many logs to write out, check the logs for the Fluentd pod."
```

#### The alerts created in the example are described as follows:

| Alert                                    | Severity              | Requires                                                             | Issue/reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FluentdPodConsistentlyLowBufferSpace** | Non-critical, warning | Immediate investigation to ensure logs are being gathered correctly. | A Fluentd pod’s available buffer size has averaged less than 75% over the last 5 minutes.<br /><br />This could mean Fluentd is having trouble communicating with the Elasticsearch cluster, the Elasticsearch cluster is down, or there are simply too many logs to process. |
