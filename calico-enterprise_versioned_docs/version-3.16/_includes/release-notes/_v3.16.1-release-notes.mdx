### What's new {#whats-new-3.16.1}

#### Application layer policy with Envoy

{{prodname}} now includes support for application layer policy with Envoy, enabling platform operators to define authorization rules in {{prodname}} policies for protocols such as HTTP and gRPC. For more information, see [Application layer policies](../network-policy/application-layer-policies/).

#### Policies for SELinux

{{prodname}} adds support for clusters that use SELinux as an additional layer of security for node operating systems. RPM packages are available to install on each node with policies that authorize the access required by {{prodname}} components. For more information, see [System requirements](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/requirements).

### Known issues {#known-issues-3.16.1}

- The ClusterInformations resource is showing the wrong versions for `calicoVersion` and `cnxVersion`. This will be addressed the next patch.
- BPF dataplane on EKS with Kubernetes 1.24, and AKS with Kubenetes 1.25 is not supported at this time. This will be addressed in the next patch.
- Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.16.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed.
