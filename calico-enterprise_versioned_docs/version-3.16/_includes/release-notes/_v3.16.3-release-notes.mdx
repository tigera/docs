### Egress gateways

The Tigera operator automatically detects and configures egress gateways to use the same iptables backend as calico-node.

### Known issues {#known-issues-v3.16.3}

- Enabling TCP stats may result in a memory leak because of a kernel bug.
- BPF dataplane on EKS with Kubernetes 1.24, and AKS with Kubernetes 1.25 is not supported at this time.
- Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.16.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed.
