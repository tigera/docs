### Known issues {#known-issues-v3.16.5}

- Enabling TCP stats may result in a memory leak because of a kernel bug.
- BPF dataplane on EKS with Kubernetes 1.24, and AKS with Kubernetes 1.25 is not supported at this time.
- Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.16.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed.
- Calico panics if kube-proxy or other components are using native `nftables` rules instead of the `iptables-nft` compatibility shim. Until Calico supports native nftables mode, we recommend that you continue to use the iptables-nft compatibility layer for all components. (The compatibility layer was the only option before Kubernetes v1.29 added alpha-level `nftables` support.) Do not run Calico in "legacy" iptables mode on a system that is also using `nftables`. Although this combination does not panic or fail (at least on kernels that support both), the interaction between `iptables` "legacy" mode and `nftables` is confusing: both `iptables` and `nftables` rules can be executed on the same packet, leading to policy verdicts being "overturned". Note that this issue applies to all previous versions of {{prodname}}.
