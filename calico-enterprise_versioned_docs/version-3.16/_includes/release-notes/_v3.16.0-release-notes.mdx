### What's new {#whats-new-3.16.0}

#### Egress gateways for AKS and Azure

{{prodname}} has added egress gateway support for Microsoft Azure and AKS.
egress gateways allow you to identify the namespaces associated with egress traffic outside your cluster.

For more information, see [Configure egress gateways, Azure](../../networking/egress/egress-gateway-azure.mdx).

#### Operator-managed deployments of egress gateways

{{prodname}} now includes Operator-managed deployments of egress gateways.
This reduces operational overhead and eliminates additional steps required during upgrades.

For more information, see [Egress gateways](../networking/egress/).

#### UI for workload-based web application firewalls

{{prodname}} includes a new UI that can be used to enable and configure a workload-based web application firewall.

For more information, see [Workload-based web application firewall](../../threat/web-application-firewall.mdx#manager-ui).

#### Service Graph performance optimizations

This release of {{prodname}} includes several optimizations to improve the performance of Service Graph for clusters with larger numbers of namespaces.

#### Revised installation steps for Rancher RKE2

{{prodname}} has revised the installation steps for Rancher RKE2 to accommodate options available in the most recent versions of that platform.

<!--The following anchor text and link need to be updated to /rke2.mdx after updates are incorporated-->
For more information, see [Rancher Manager](../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/rancher-ui.mdx).

#### Improvements to Envoy to accommodate advanced ingress controllers

{{prodname}} includes improvements to its Envoy deployment to enable customers to use this feature in clusters with ingress controllers that perform advanced load balancing.

For more information, see [Workload-based web application firewall](../../threat/web-application-firewall.mdx).

#### Support for multiple external networks

{{prodname}} includes networking options that allows pods from different namespaces to egress onto different external networks (Virtual Routing Functions or VRFs) that may have overlapping IPs with each other.
This also enables administrators to configure which service IPs are advertised for a network by the service IP advertisement feature.

For more information, see [Configure egress traffic to multiple external networks](../../networking/egress/external-network.mdx).

#### Improved product security with more restrictive `SecurityContext`

{{prodname}} has updated its components to apply a more restrictive `SecurityContext` where applicable.
This includes the following:
* Non-root context whenever possible and added drop ALL `Capabilities`
* Root context and privilege escalation are used only when necessary
* `SeccompProfile` is set to `RuntimeDefault`

### Known issues {#known-issues-3.16.0}

* L7 log collection fails to deploy on CIS hardened clusters. As a result, some cards in the manager UI dashboard will not display any metrics.
* Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.16.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
