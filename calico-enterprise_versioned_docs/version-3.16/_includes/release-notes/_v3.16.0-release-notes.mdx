| Feature | Description...                                               | Doc link                                                     | Blogs |

| Policy recommendations                                       | Improve the security posture of your Kubernetes cluster in the early stages of onboarding with {{prodname}}, by implementing automatic namespace isolation with network policy. Namespace isolation helps to implement a zero-trust and least-privileged security model, where only required communication between namespaces are authorized and everything else is blocked. This helps mitigate the risk of lateral movement within a cluster in the event of an attack.<br /><br />Just enable policy recommendations and get a staged network policy for viewing traffic . | https://deploy-preview-409--tigera.netlify.app/calico-enterprise/next/network-policy/recommendations/policy-recommendations | TBD   |

| Threat defense  | WAF UI                                      | Enable WAF in Manager UI.                                    | https://docs.tigera.io/calico-enterprise/3.16/threat/web-application-firewall |
|                 | Anomaly detection                           | When an anomaly detection job is disabled, and appropriate **metadata** is not available (e.g. processes, tcp stats), provide help on the configuration required to enable it. | https://docs.tigera.io/calico-enterprise/3.16/threat/anomaly-detection/security-anomalies |
| Network policy  | DNS rules in                                | Leverage [NodeLocal DNSCache](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/nodelocaldns/) to improve the performance of DNS services running with the cluster. Secure egress access for application workloads while ensuring the best possible performance for DNS services. | https://docs.tigera.io/calico-enterprise/3.16/network-policy/domain-based-policy |
| Data encryption | WireGuard support for AKS/EKS               | Enable WireGuard to secure on-the-wire, in-cluster pod traffic in {{prodname}} cluster for AKS/EKS. | https://docs.tigera.io/calico-enterprise/3.16/compliance/encrypt-cluster-pod-traffic |
| Networking      | Destination-base routing for egress gateway | Designate different egress gateways depending on the target destination.  Define multiple egress gateways in a namespace or pod so that traffic intended for internet could be routed through one egress gateway where traffic intended for an internal subnet can be routed through another egress gateway. | TBD                                                          |
| Log storage     | Linseed API                                 | A new service for accessing Elasticsearch and new index patterns for log storage. | https://docs.tigera.io/calico-enterprise/3.16/reference/architecture/overview |


### Known issues

* L7 log collection fails to deploy on CIS hardened clusters. As a result, some cards in the manager UI dashboard will not display any metrics.
* Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.16.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
