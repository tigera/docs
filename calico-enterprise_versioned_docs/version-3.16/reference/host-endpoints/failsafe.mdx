# Failsafe rules

To avoid completely cutting off a host via incorrect or malformed
policy, {{prodname}} has a failsafe mechanism that keeps various pinholes open
in the firewall.

By default, {{prodname}} keeps the following ports open on _all_ host endpoints:

| Port | Protocol | Direction          | Purpose                        |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 22   | TCP      | Inbound            | SSH access                     |
| 53   | UDP      | Outbound           | DNS queries                    |
| 67   | UDP      | Outbound           | DHCP access                    |
| 68   | UDP      | Inbound            | DHCP access                    |
| 179  | TCP      | Inbound & Outbound | BGP access (Calico networking) |
| 6443 | TCP      | Inbound & Outbound | Kubernetes API server access   |

The lists of failsafe ports can be configured via the configuration parameters
`FailsafeInboundHostPorts` and `FailsafeOutboundHostPorts`
described in [Configuring
Felix](../component-resources/node/felix/configuration.mdx). They
can be disabled by setting each configuration value to "none".

:::note

Removing the inbound failsafe rules can leave a host inaccessible.

Removing the outbound failsafe rules can leave Felix unable to connect
to the datastore.

Before disabling the failsafe rules, we recommend creating a policy to
replace it with more-specific rules for your environment: see
[Creating policy for basic connectivity](connectivity.mdx).
