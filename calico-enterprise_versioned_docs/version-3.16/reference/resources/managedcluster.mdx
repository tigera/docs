# Managed Cluster

A Managed Cluster resource (`ManagedCluster`) represents a cluster managed by a centralized management plane with a shared Elasticsearch.
The management plane provides central control of the managed cluster and stores its logs.

{{prodname}} supports connecting multiple {{prodname}} clusters as describe in the [Multi-cluster management] installation guide.

For `kubectl` commands, the following case-insensitive aliases may be used to specify the resource type on the CLI:
`managedcluster`,`managedclusters`, `managedcluster.projectcalico.org`, `managedclusters.projectcalico.org` as well as
abbreviations such as `managedcluster.p` and `managedclusters.p`.

## Sample YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: managed-cluster
spec:
  operatorNamespace: tigera-operator
```

## Managed cluster definition

### Metadata

| Field | Description                                               | Accepted Values                                     | Schema |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| name  | Unique name to describe this resource instance. Required. | Alphanumeric string with optional `.`, `_`, or `-`. | string |

- `cluster` is a reserved name for the management plane and is considered an invalid value

### Spec

| Field                | Description                                                                                                       | Accepted Values | Schema | Default |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------ | ------- |
| installationManifest | Installation Manifest to be applied on a managed cluster infrastructure                                           | None            | string | `Empty` |
| operatorNamespace    | The namespace of the managed cluster's operator. This value is used in the generation of the InstallationManifest | None            | string | `Empty` |

- `installationManifest` field can be retrieved only once at creation time. Updates are not supported for this field.

To extract the installation manifest at creation time `-o jsonpath="{.spec.installationManifest}"` parameters
can be used with a `kubectl` command.

### Status

Status represents the latest observed status of Managed cluster. The `status` is read-only for users and updated by the
{{prodname}} components.

| Field      | Description                                                                | Schema                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| conditions | List of condition that describe the current status of the Managed cluster. | List of ManagedClusterStatusConditions |

**ManagedClusterStatusConditions**

Conditions represent the latest observed set of conditions for a Managed cluster. The connection between a management
plane and managed plane will be reported as following:

- `Unknown` when no initial connection has been established
- `True` when both planes have an established connection
- `False` when neither planes have an established connection

| Field  | Description                                                               | Accepted Values            | Schema | Default                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| type   | Type of status that is being reported                                     | -                          | string | `ManagedClusterConnected` |
| status | Status of the connection between a Managed cluster and management cluster | `Unknown`, `True`, `False` | string | `Unknown`                 |
