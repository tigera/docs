# Get started with policy recommendations

## Big picture

Enable continuous policy recommendations.

## Value

After you install {{prodname}}, the recommended zero-trust security stance is to deny traffic flows to protect the cluster. Although this is a good thing, allowing traffic requires writing tiered network policy. Writing policy for tiers that follows best practices can be an obstacle to quickly getting clusters up to observe allowed traffic. 

Developers with no experience can get {{prodname}} policy recommendations that allow traffic, but still secure workloads to/from the cluster’s namespaces. In a safe staging environment, developers can immediately get visibility into the impact of network traffic flows. 

## Before you begin

**Required**

To enable/disable policy recommendation, you must have the **tigera-admin** role or permissions to the **Policy Recommendations** resource. 

**Recommended**
Basic knowledge of policies and tiers:
- [Network policy tutorial]()
- [Get started with tiered network policy]()

**Limitations**

In this release, managing policy recommendations is available only in Manager UI. `kubectl` commands are available to update Policy Recommendations parameters.

## How to

- [Enable policy recommendations](#enable-policy-recommendations)
- [Activate policy recommendations](#activate-policy-recommendations) 
- [Manage policy recommendations](#manage-policy-recommendations)
- [Troubleshoot policy recommendations](#troubleshoot-policy-recommendations)
- [Change policy recommendations parameters](#change-policy-recommendations-parameters)
- [Disable policy recommendations](#disable-policy-recommendations)

### Enable policy recommendations

1. In the left navbar in Manager UI, click **Policy**, **Recommendations**.
1. On the opt-in page, click **Enable Policy Recommendations**.

   ![Enable policy recommendations](/img/calico-enterprise/enable-policy-recommendations.png)

The **Policy Recommendations** board is automatically displayed. 

![Policy recommendations board](/img/calico-enterprise/policy-recommendations-board.png)

**Notes**:
- A policy recommendation is generated for every namespace in your cluster (unless namespaces are filtered out using the PolicyRecommendationScope resource)
- Traffic originating from the policy recommendation namespace is used to generate egress rules, and traffic destined for the namespace is used to define ingress rules
- Flow log patterns and processes are continuously monitored for policy recommendations. As the cluster changes (new namespaces are created or new components are added), you can get a new policy recommendation. 
- Policy recommendations are automatically converted to **Staged network policies** so you can safely observe the traffic before enforcing them
- If you do not want a policy recommendation to be processed or updated with further recommendations, click the **Action** menu, **Dismiss policy**. 

### Activate policy recommendations

Policy recommendations are not active until you move them to the **Policies Board. 

From the Policy Recommendation board, select a policy recommendation (or bulk select) and select, Add to policy board.  

In the left navbar, click **Policies**.

![Policies board](/img/calico-enterprise/policies-board.png)

Policy recommendations are added to the **namespace-segmentation** tier. Note the following:

- The `namespace-segmentation` tier name is fixed and cannot be changed
- Staged network policy recommendations function like any other staged network policies; they are differentiated from regular staged policies by the `recommendation` suffix
- You can move policy recommendation staged policies to other tiers

You are now ready to observe the allowed traffic of your policy in Service Graph to see if the policy meets your needs. A best practice is to assess the impact of a policy recommendation before enforcing it. See [Stage, preview impacts, and enforce policy](staged-network-policies.mdx) for help. 

:::note 

{{prodname}} has an on-the-fly version of policy recommendations called, **Recommend a policy** (on the Policies Board, Edit page). Although similar to policy recommendations (both generate time-stamped policy recommendations), they are different features. To create an on-the-fly policy recommendation, see Recommend a policy](../policy-impact-preview).

### Manage policy recommendations

As new namespace and components are added to a cluster, your policy recommendation won’t allow traffic to them. If a policy recommendation has not been enforced, you’ll need to update it to allow traffic.

**To get a new policy recommendation for an existing staged recommended policy**:

1. On the Policies Recommendations page, click the **Active tab** which lists the active staged network policies. 
1. Select the Actions drop-down associated with the policy in question, and click **Dismiss policy**. 
1. Click the **Dismissed tab**, select the Actions drop-down, and Reactivate the policy.

**To get a new policy recommendation for an existing enforced policy recommendation**, delete or rename the policy so a new staged network policy is recreated in the Policy Recommendations page. 

## Troubleshoot policy recommendations

To view error logs in Kibana, go to **Logs**, and access the `tigera-policy-recommendation` namespace.

**Problem**: I’m not seeing policy recommendations on the Policy Recommendations board.
**Solution/workaround**: Policy recommendations are based on historical flow logs that match a request, and are generated only for flows that are denying traffic. As such, there are times when policy recommendations will not be generated:

- Not enough traffic history 

   If you recently installed {{prodname}}, you may not have enough traffic history. Workloads must run for some time (ballpark is 5 days) to get “typical network traffic” for applications.

- Denied traffic flows are covered by existing policy

   Even if your cluster has been running for a long time with traffic flows, the flows may already be covered by existing policies. 

To verify that you have traffic flows, follow these steps:

1. In the left navbar, go to **Service Graph**, **Default**.
1. On the left, click the chevron to open **Namespaces**.
1. Search for a namespace. 
   Note: It may take a few minutes for flows to appear in results.
1. Scroll over to the flow log’s policies field to investigate which policy or policies denied this flow. (For help, see [Flow log types](../../visibility/elastic/flow/datatypes#big-picture).

If you do not have denied traffic, but still want to test policy recommendations, you can create sample pods, namespaces, and denied traffic. For help, see [Create denied traffic flows to get policy recommendations](../network-policy/denied-traffic-flows). 

### Change policy recommendations parameters

You can change policy recommendation parameters using the [Policy recommendation resource](../reference/resources/policyrecommendations). For example, you may want to change the interval for which you want flow logs to be processed, or the amount of time you want for a policy to keep processing flows for until it’s considered stable. You can also filter out namespaces. 

### Disable policy recommendations 

There are several reasons why you may want to disable policy recommendations. If you do, activated staged network policies are not affected, including enforced policies. Unactivated policies in the Policies Board are no longer actively updated. 

To disable policy recommendations, set the **RecStatus** parameter to `Disabled` in the [Policy recommendation](../reference/resources/policyrecommendations)resource.
