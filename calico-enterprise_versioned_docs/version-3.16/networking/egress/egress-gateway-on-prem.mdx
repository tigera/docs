# Configure egress gateways, on-premises

## Big picture

Configure specific application traffic to exit the cluster through an egress gateway.

## Value

When traffic from particular applications leaves the cluster to access an external destination, it
can be useful to control the source IP of that traffic. For example, there may be an additional
firewall around the cluster, whose purpose includes policing external accesses from the cluster, and
specifically that particular external destinations can only be accessed from authorised workloads
within the cluster.

{{prodname}}'s own policy (including [DNS policy](../../network-policy/domain-based-policy.mdx)) and
per-node firewalls can ensure this, but deployments may like to deepen their defense by adding an
external firewall as well. If the external firewall is configured to allow outbound connections
only from particular source IPs, and the intended cluster workloads can be configured so that their
outbound traffic will have one of those source IPs, then the defense in depth objective is achieved.

{{prodname}} allows specifying an [IP pool](../../reference/resources/ippool.mdx) for each pod or namespace, and
even a [specific IP](../ipam/use-specific-ip.mdx) for a new pod, but this requires predicting how many pods
there will be representing a particular application, so that the IP pool can be correctly sized.
When IPs are a precious resource, over-sizing the pool is wasteful; but under-sizing is also
problematic, as then IPs will not be available within the desired range as the application is
scaled.

Egress gateways provide an alternative approach. Application pods and namespaces are provisioned
with IPs from the default (and presumably plentiful) pool, but also configured so that their
outbound traffic is directed through an egress gateway. (Or, for resilience, through one of a small
number of egress gateways.) The egress gateways are set up to use a [specific IP
pool](../ipam/legacy-firewalls.mdx) and to perform an SNAT on the traffic passing through them. Hence, any
number of application pods can have their outbound connections multiplexed through a fixed small
number of egress gateways, and all of those outbound connections acquire a source IP from the egress
gateway IP pool.

:::note

The source port of an outbound flow through an egress gateway can generally _not_ be
preserved. Changing the source port is how Linux maps flows from many upstream IPs onto a single
downstream IP.

:::

Egress gateways are also useful if there is a reason for wanting all outbound traffic from a
particular application to leave the cluster through a particular node or nodes. For this case, the
gateways just need to be scheduled to the desired nodes, and the application pods/namespaces
configured to use those gateways.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following features:

Kubernetes **Namespace** and **Pod** resources with these {{prodname}} annotations:

- egress.projectcalico.org/namespaceSelector
- egress.projectcalico.org/selector

## Concepts

### Egress gateway

An egress gateway acts as a transit pod for the outbound application traffic that is configured to
use it. As traffic leaving the cluster passes through the egress gateway, its source IP is changed
to that of the egress gateway pod, and the traffic is then forwarded on.

### Source IP

When an outbound application flow leaves the cluster, its IP packets will have a source IP.
Normally this is the pod IP of the pod that originated the flow, or the node IP of the node hosting
that pod. It will be the **node IP** if the pod IP came from an [IP pool](../../reference/resources/ippool.mdx) with `natOutgoing: true`, and the **pod IP** if
not. (Assuming no other CNI plugin has been configured to NAT outgoing traffic.)

With an egress gateway involved that is all still true, except that now it's the egress gateway that
counts, instead of the original application pod. So the flow will have the egress gateway's **node
IP**, if the egress gateway's pod IP came from an [IP
pool](../../reference/resources/ippool.mdx) with `natOutgoing: true`, and the egress
gateway's **pod IP** otherwise.

### Control the use of egress gateways

If a cluster ascribes special meaning to traffic flowing through egress gateways, it will be
important to control when cluster users can configure their pods and namespaces to use them, so that
non-special pods cannot impersonate the special meaning.

If namespaces in a cluster can only be provisioned by cluster admins, one option is to enable egress
gateway function only on a per-namespace basis. Then only cluster admins will be able to configure
any egress gateway usage.

Otherwise -- if namespace provisioning is open to users in general, or if it's desirable for egress
gateway function to be enabled both per-namespace and per-pod -- a [Kubernetes admission
controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) will be
needed. This is a task for each deployment to implement for itself, but possible approaches include
the following.

1.  Decide whether a given Namespace or Pod is permitted to use egress annotations at all, based on
    other details of the Namespace or Pod definition.

1.  Evaluate egress annotation selectors to determine the egress gateways that they map to, and
    decide whether that usage is acceptable.

1.  Impose the cluster's own bespoke scheme for a Namespace or Pod to identify the egress gateways
    that it wants to use, less general than {{prodname}}'s egress annotations. Then the
    admission controller would police those bespoke annotations (that that cluster's users could
    place on Namespace or Pod resources) and either reject the operation in hand, or allow it
    through after adding the corresponding {{prodname}} egress annotations.

### Policy enforcement for flows via an egress gateway

For an outbound connection from a client pod, via an egress gateway, to a destination outside the
cluster, there is more than one possible enforcement point for policy:

The path of the traffic through policy is as follows:

1. Packet leaves the client pod and passes through its egress policy.
2. The packet is encapsulated by the client pod's host and sent to the egress gateway
3. The encapsulated packet is sent from the host to the egress gateway pod.
4. The egress gateway pod de-encapsulates the packet and send the packet out again with its own address.
5. The packet leaves the egress gateway pod through its egress policy.

To ensure correct operation, (as of v3.15) the encapsulated traffic between host and egress gateway is auto-allowed by
{{prodname}} and other ingress traffic is blocked. That means that there are effectively two places where
policy can be applied:

1.  on egress from the client pod
2.  on egress from the egress gateway pod (see limitations below).

The policy applied at (1) is the most powerful since it implicitly sees the original source of the traffic (by
virtue of being attached to that original source). It also sees the external destination of the traffic.

Since an egress gateway will never originate its own traffic, one option is to rely on policy applied at (1) and
to allow all traffic to at (2) (either by applying no policy or by applying an "allow all").

Alternatively, for maximum "defense in depth" applying policy at both (1) and (2) provides extra protection should
the policy at (1) be disabled or bypassed by an attacker. Policy at (2) has the following limitations:

- [Domain-based policy](../../network-policy/domain-based-policy.mdx) is not supported at egress from egress
  gateways. It will either fail to match the expected traffic, or it will work intermittently if the egress gateway
  happens to be scheduled to the same node as its clients. This is because any DNS lookup happens at the client pod.
  By the time the policy reaches (2) the DNS information is lost and only the IP addresses of the traffic are available.

- The traffic source will appear to be the egress gateway pod, the source information is lost in the address
  translation that occurs inside the egress gateway pod.

That means that policies at (2) will usually take the form of rules that match only on destination port and IP address,
either directly in the rule (via a CIDR match) or via a (non-domain based) NetworkSet. Matching on source has little
utility since the IP will always be the egress gateway and the port of translated traffic is not always preserved.

:::note

Since v3.15.0, {{prodname}} also sends health probes to the egress gateway pods from the nodes where
their clients are located. In iptables mode, this traffic is auto-allowed at egress from the host and ingress
to the egress gateway. In eBPF mode, the probe traffic can be blocked by policy, so you must ensure that this traffic allowed; this should be fixed in an upcoming
patch release.

### Enable egress gateway support

In the default **FelixConfiguration**, set the `egressIPSupport` field to `EnabledPerNamespace` or
`EnabledPerNamespaceOrPerPod`, according to the level of support that you need in your cluster. For
support on a per-namespace basis only:

```bash
kubectl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p \
    '{"spec":{"egressIPSupport":"EnabledPerNamespace"}}'
```

Or for support both per-namespace and per-pod:

```bash
kubectl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p \
    '{"spec":{"egressIPSupport":"EnabledPerNamespaceOrPerPod"}}'
```

:::note

- `egressIPSupport` must be the same on all cluster nodes, so you should set them only in the
  `default` FelixConfiguration resource.
- The operator automatically enables the required policy sync API in the FelixConfiguration.

:::

### Provision an egress IP pool

Provision a small IP Pool with the range of source IPs that you want to use for a particular
application when it connects to an external service. For example:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: IPPool
metadata:
  name: egress-ippool-1
spec:
  cidr: 10.10.10.0/30
  blockSize: 31
  nodeSelector: "!all()"
EOF
```

Where:

- `blockSize` must be specified when the prefix length of the whole `cidr` is more than the default `blockSize` of 26.

- `nodeSelector: "!all()"` is recommended so that this egress IP pool is not accidentally used for cluster pods in general. Specifying this `nodeSelector` means that the IP pool is only used for pods that explicitly identify it in their `cni.projectcalico.org/ipv4pools` annotation.

- Set `ipipMode` or `vxlanMode` to `Always` if the pod network has [IPIP or VXLAN](../configuring/vxlan-ipip.mdx) enabled.

  :::note

  This setting is not specific to egress gateway. In some cases where nodes happen to be in the same subnet, setting the value to `Never`will work the same as `Always`. It all depends on the hop from the client node to the egress gateway node. For example, if the client nodes are in the same AWS subnet, and you are using `Always` because some of the nodes are in different subnets, then `Never` will work for the egress IP Pool when the client and gateway nodes are in the same subnet.

  :::

### Deploy a group of egress gateways

Use an egress gateway custom resource to deploy a group of egress gateways, using the egress IP Pool.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: EgressGateway
metadata:
  name: egress-gateway
  namespace: default
spec:
  logSeverity: "Info"
  replicas: 1
  ipPools:
  - cidr: "10.10.10.0/30"
  egressGatewayFailureDetection:
    healthTimeoutDataStoreSeconds: 30
    icmpProbe:
      ips: ["34.56.2.7"]
      timeoutSeconds: 15
      intervalSeconds: 5
    httpProbe:
      urls: ["http://example.com"]
      timeoutSeconds: 30
      intervalSeconds: 10
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        egress-code: red
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/os: linux
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
EOF
```

Where:

- It is advisable to have more than one egress gateway per group, so that the egress IP function continues if one of the gateways crashes or needs to be restarted. When there are multiple gateways in a group, outbound traffic from the applications using that group is load-balanced across the available gateways. The number of `replicas` specified must be less than or equal to the number of free IP addresses in the IP Pool.

- IPPool can be specified either by its name (e.g. `-name: egress-ippool-1`) or by its CIDR (e.g. `-cidr: 10.10.10.0/31`).

- The labels are arbitrary. You can choose whatever names and values are convenient for your cluster's Namespaces and Pods to refer to in their egress selectors.

  If labels are not specified, a default label `projectcalico.org/egw`:`name` will be added by the Tigera Operator.

- icmpProbe may be used to specify the Probe IPs, ICMP interval and timeout in seconds. `ips` if set, the
  egress gateway pod will probe each IP periodically using an ICMP ping. If all pings fail then the egress
  gateway will report non-ready via its health port. `intervalSeconds` controls the interval between probes.
  `timeoutSeconds` controls the timeout before reporting non-ready if no probes succeed.

  ```yaml
  icmpProbe:
    ips:
    - probeIP
    - probeIP
    timeoutSeconds: 20
    intervalSeconds: 10
  ```

- httpProbe may be used to specify the Probe URLs, HTTP interval and timeout in seconds. `urls` if set, the
  egress gateway pod will probe each external service periodically. If all probes fail then the egress
  gateway will report non-ready via its health port. `intervalSeconds` controls the interval between probes.
  `timeoutSeconds` controls the timeout before reporting non-ready if all probes are failing.

  ```yaml
  httpProbe:
    urls:
    - probeURL
    - probeURL
    timeoutSeconds: 30
    intervalSeconds: 10
  ```
- Please refer to the [operator reference docs](../../reference/installation/api.mdx) for details about the egress gateway resource type.

The health port `8080` is used by:

- The Kubernetes `readinessProbe` to expose the status of the egress gateway pod (and any ICMP/HTTP
  probes).
- Remote pods to check if the egress gateway is "ready". Only "ready" egress
  gateways will be used for remote client traffic. This traffic is automatically allowed by {{prodname}} and
  no policy is required to allow it. {{prodname}} only sends probes to egress gateway pods that have a named
  "health" port. This ensures that during an upgrade, health probes are only sent to upgraded egress gateways.

### Deploying on a RKE2 CIS Hardened Cluster

If you are deploying `egress-gateway` on a RKE2 CIS-hardened cluster, its `PodSecurityPolicies` restrict the `securityContext` and `volumes` required by egress gateway. When deploying using the egress gateway custom resource, the Tigera Operator sets up `PodSecurityPolicy`, `Role`, `RoleBinding` and associated `ServiceAccount`.

### Configure iptables backend for egress gateways

As of v3.16.3, the operator automatically configures egress gateways to use the same iptables backend as calico-node.
This is controlled by the `iptablesBackend` field in the FelixConfiguration.  If not specified or set to `auto`,
the egress gateway will attempt to autodetect the correct value preferring nft if available.

Prior to v3.16.3, it was not possible to set the iptables backend; the effective value was fixed at `legacy`.

### Configure a Namespace or Pod to use egress gateways

In a {{prodname}} deployment, the Kubernetes Namespace and Pod resources honor annotations that
tell that namespace or pod to use particular egress gateways. These annotations are selectors, and
their meaning is "the set of pods, anywhere in the cluster, that match those selectors".

So, to configure that all of the pods in a namespace should use the egress gateways that are
labelled with `egress-code: red`, you would annotate that namespace like this:

```bash
kubectl annotate ns <namespace> egress.projectcalico.org/selector="egress-code == 'red'"
```

By default that selector can only match egress gateways in the same namespace. To select gateways
in a different namespace, specify a `namespaceSelector` annotation as well, like this:

```bash
kubectl annotate ns <namespace> egress.projectcalico.org/namespaceSelector="projectcalico.org/name == 'default'"
```

Egress gateway annotations have the same [syntax and range of
expressions](../../reference/resources/networkpolicy.mdx#selector) as the selector fields in
{{prodname}} [network policy](../../reference/resources/networkpolicy.mdx#entityrule).

To configure a specific Kubernetes Pod to use egress gateways, specify the same annotations when
creating the pod. For example:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    egress.projectcalico.org/selector: egress-code == 'red'
    egress.projectcalico.org/namespaceSelector: projectcalico.org/name == 'default'
  name: my-client,
  namespace: my-namespace,
spec:
  ...
EOF
```

### Optionally enable ECMP load balancing

If you are provisioning multiple egress gateways for a given client pod, and you want
traffic from that client to load balance across the available gateways, set the
`fib_multipath_hash_policy`
[sysctl](https://sysctl-explorer.net/net/ipv4/fib_multipath_hash_policy/) to allow that:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.fib_multipath_hash_policy=1
```

You will need this on each node with clients that you want to load balance across multiple
egress gateways.

### Verify the feature operation

To verify the feature operation, cause the application pod to initiate a connection to a server
outside the cluster, and observe -- for example using tcpdump -- the source IP of the connection
packet as it reaches the server.

:::note

In order for such a connection to complete, the server must know how to route back to
the egress gateway's IP.

:::

By way of a concrete example, you could use netcat to run a test server outside the cluster; for
example:

```bash
docker run --net=host --privileged subfuzion/netcat -v -l -k -p 8089
```

Then provision an egress IP Pool, and egress gateways, as above.

Then deploy a pod, with egress annotations as above, and with any image that includes netcat, for example:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-netcat-pod
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  containers:
  - name: alpine
    image: alpine
    command: ["/bin/sleep"]
    args: ["infinity"]
EOF
```

Now you can use `kubectl exec` to initiate an outbound connection from that pod:

```bash
kubectl exec <pod name> -n <pod namespace> -- nc <server IP> 8089 </dev/null
```

where `<server IP>` should be the IP address of the netcat server.

Then, if you check the logs or output of the netcat server, you should see:

```
Connection from <source IP> <source port> received
```

with `<source IP>` being one of the IPs of the egress IP pool that you provisioned.

## Upgrade egress gateways

From v3.16, egress gateway deployments are managed by the Tigera Operator.

- When upgrading from a pre-v3.16 release, no automatic upgrade will occur. To upgrade a pre-v3.16 egress gateway deployment,
  create an equivalent EgressGateway resource with the same namespace and the same name as mentioned [above](#deploy-a-group-of-egress-gateways);
  the operator will then take over management of the old Deployment resource, replacing it with the upgraded version.

- Use `kubectl apply` to create the egress gateway resource. Tigera Operator will read the newly created resource and wait
  for the other {{prodname}} components to be upgraded. Once the other {{prodname}} components are upgraded, Tigera Operator
  will upgrade the existing egress gateway deployment with the new image.

By default, upgrading egress gateways will sever any connections that are flowing through them. To minimise impact,
the egress gateway feature supports some advanced options that give feedback to affected pods. For more details see
the [egress gateway maintenance guide](egress-gateway-maintenance.mdx).
