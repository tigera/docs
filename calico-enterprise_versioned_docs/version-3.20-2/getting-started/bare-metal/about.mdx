# Install Calico on non-cluster hosts and VMs

## Big picture

Secure hosts and virtual machines (VMs) running outside of Kubernetes by installing {{prodname}}.

## Value

Calico Enterprise can also be used to protect hosts and VMs running outside of a Kubernetes cluster. In many cases, these are applications and workloads that cannot be easily containerized. {{prodname}} lets you protect and gain visibility into these **non-cluster hosts** and use the same robust Calico network policy that you use for pods.

## Concepts

### Non-cluster hosts and host endpoints

A non-cluster host or VM is a computer that is running an application that is _not part of a Kubernetes cluster_. {{prodname}} enables you to protect these hosts and VMs using the same Calico network policy that you use for workloads running inside a Kubernetes cluster. It also generates flow logs that provide visibility into the communication that host or VM is having with other endpoints in your environment.

In the following diagram, a Kubernetes cluster is running {{prodname}} with networking (for pod-to-pod communication) and network policy; the non-cluster host uses Calico network policy for host protection and to generate flow logs for observability.

For non-cluster hosts and VMs, you can secure host interfaces using **host endpoints**. Host endpoints can have labels that work the same as labels on pods/workload endpoints in Kubernetes. The advantage is that you can write network policy rules to apply to both workload endpoints and host endpoints using label selectors; where each selector can refer to the either type (or be a mix of the two). For example, you can easily write a global policy that applies to every host, VM, or pod that is running Calico.

To learn how to restrict traffic to/from hosts using Calico network policy see, [Protect hosts and VMs](../../network-policy/hosts/protect-hosts.mdx).

## Before you begin

**Required**

- Kubernetes API datastore is up and running and is accessible from the host

  If {{prodname}} is installed on a cluster, you already have a datastore.

- Non-cluster host or VM meets {{prodname}} [system requirements](../install-on-clusters/requirements.mdx)

  Ensure that your node OS includes the `ipset` and `conntrack` kernel dependencies.

## How to

### Set up your Kubernetes cluster to work with a non-cluster host or VM

1. Apply the `NonClusterHost` custom resource. The `endpoint` field is required. It defines the remote endpoint for the non-cluster host log forwarder.

   ```bash
   kubectl create -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: NonClusterHost
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   spec:
     endpoint: <endpoint for non-cluster host log forwarder>
   EOF
   ```

   Wait until the manager shows a status of Available, then proceed to the next step.

1. Obtain the token for `tigera-noncluster-host` service account.

   ```bash
   kubectl get secret -n calico-system tigera-noncluster-host -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode
   ```

1. Use a text editor to create a kubeconfig file for non-cluster host or VM.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Config
   current-context: noncluster-hosts
   preferences: {}
   clusters:
   - cluster:
       Certificate-authority-data: <your cluster certificate>
       server: <your cluster server>
     name: noncluster-hosts
   contexts:
   - context:
       cluster: noncluster-hosts
       user: tigera-noncluster-host
     name: noncluster-hosts
   users:
   - name: tigera-noncluster-host
     user:
       token: <token from previous step>
   ```

   Take the cluster information from an already existing kubeconfig.

1. Create a [`HostEndpoint` resource](../../reference/host-endpoints/overview.mdx) for each non-cluster host or VM. The `node` and `expectedIPs` fields are required to match the hostname and the expected interface IP addresses.

1. Follow [Configure access to {{prodname}} Manager UI](../../operations/cnx/access-the-manager.mdx) page to configure {{prodname}} Manager access.

### Set up your non-cluster host or VM

1. Install Calico node and fluent-bit log forwarder packages.

   - If your non-cluster host or VM has RHEL 8 installed, then run the following command:

     ```bash
     dnf install https://downloads.tigera.io/ee/archives/calico-node-3.20~pre2.0.el8.x86_64.rpm
     dnf install https://downloads.tigera.io/ee/archives/calico-fluent-bit-3.1.8.el8.x86_64.rpm
     ```

   - If your non-cluster host or VM has RHEL 9 installed, then run the following command:

     ```bash
     dnf install https://downloads.tigera.io/ee/archives/calico-node-3.20~pre2.0.el9.x86_64.rpm
     dnf install https://downloads.tigera.io/ee/archives/calico-fluent-bit-3.1.8.el9.x86_64.rpm
     ```

     Only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 x86-64 operating systems are supported in this version of {{prodname}}.

1. Copy the kubeconfig created in cluster setup step 3 to host folder `/etc/calico/kubeconfig` and change ownership to `calico:calico`.

1. Start Calico node and log forwarder.

   ```bash
   systemctl start calico-node.service
   systemctl start calico-fluent-bit.service
   ```

   You can configure the Calico node by tuning the environment variables defined in the `/etc/calico/calico-node/calico-node.env` file. For more information, see the [Felix configuration reference](../../reference/resources/felixconfig.mdx).

### Configure hosts to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster

Using {{prodname}} network policy-only mode (i.e. with other CNIs), you must ensure that the non-cluster host or VM can directly communicate with your Kubernetes cluster. Here are some vendor tips:

#### AWS

- For hosts to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster, the node must be in the same VPC as nodes in your Kubernetes cluster, and must use the AWS VPC CNI plugin (used by default in EKS).
- The Kubernetes cluster security group needs to allow traffic from your host endpoint. Make sure that an inbound rule is set so that traffic from your host endpoint node is allowed.
- For a non-cluster host to communicate with an EKS cluster, the correct IAM roles must be configured.
- You also need to provide authentication to your Kubernetes cluster using [aws-iam-authenticator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html) and the [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

#### GKE

For hosts to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster directly, you must make the host directly reachable/routable; this is not set up by default with the VPC native network routing.
