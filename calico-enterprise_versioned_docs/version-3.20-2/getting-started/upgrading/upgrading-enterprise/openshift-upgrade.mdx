# Upgrade Calico Enterprise installed with OpenShift

:::note

All upgrades in $[prodname] are free with a valid license.

:::

## Upgrades paths

You can upgrade your cluster to a maximum of **two releases** from your existing version. For example, if you are on version 3.16, you can upgrade to 3.17, or you can upgrade directly to 3.18. However, you cannot upgrade beyond **two releases**; upgrading from 3.16 to 3.19 (three releases) is not supported.

If you are several versions behind where you want to be, you must go through each group of two releases to get there. For example, if you are on version 3.16, and you want to get to 3.20, you can upgrade to 3.18, then upgrade from 3.18 directly to 3.20.

:::note

Always check the [Release Notes](../../../release-notes/index.mdx) for exceptions; limitations can override the above pattern.

:::

## Prerequisites

Ensure that your $[prodname] OpenShift cluster is running a supported version of [OpenShift Container Platform](../../compatibility.mdx#openshift), and the $[prodname] operator version is v1.2.4 or greater.

:::note

You can check if you are running the operator by checking for the existence of the operator namespace
with `oc get ns tigera-operator` or issuing `oc get tigerastatus`; a successful return means your installation is
using the operator.

:::

## Prepare your cluster for the upgrade

During upgrade, the $[prodname] LogStorage CR is temporarily removed so Elasticsearch can be upgraded. Features
that depend on LogStorage are temporarily unavailable, including dashboards in the web console. Data ingestion is paused
temporarily, but resumes when the LogStorage is up and running again.

To retain data from your current installation (optional), ensure that the currently mounted persistent volumes
have their reclaim policy set to [retain data](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-pv-reclaim-policy/).
Data retention is recommended only for users that have a valid Elasticsearch license. (Trial licenses can be invalidated
during upgrade).

### Upgrade OwnerReferences

If you do not use OwnerReferences on resources in the projectcalico.org/v3 API group, you can skip this section.

Starting in $[prodname] v3.19, a change in the way UIDs are generated for projectcalico.org/v3 resources requires that you update any OwnerReferences
that refer to projectcalico.org/v3 resources as an owner. After upgrade, the UID for all projectcalico.org/v3 resources will be changed, resulting in any
owned resources being garbage collected by Kubernetes.

1. Remove any OwnerReferences from resources in your cluster that have `apiGroup: projectcalico.org/v3`.
1. Perform the upgrade normally.
1. Add new OwnerReferences to your resources referencing the new UID.

### Default Deny

$[prodname] creates a default-deny for the calico-system namespace. If you deploy workloads into the calico-system namespace, you must create policy that allows the required traffic for your workloads prior to upgrade.

### Windows

If your cluster has Windows nodes and uses custom TLS certificates for log storage, prior to upgrade, prepare and apply new certificates for [log storage](../../../operations/comms/log-storage-tls.mdx) that include the required service DNS names.

### Multi-cluster management

For $[prodname] v3.5 and v3.7, upgrading multi-cluster management setups must include updating all managed and management clusters.

### Egress gateway

If your cluster has egress gateway in a non-default namespace, ensure the namespace is privileged by adding the following to the namespace:

##### Label
```
openshift.io/run-level: "0"
pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged
pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: latest
```
##### Annotation
```
security.openshift.io/scc.podSecurityLabelSync: "false"
```

## Download the new manifests

Make a manifests directory.

```bash
mkdir manifests
```

<InstallOpenShiftManifests upgradeFrom='Enterprise' />

# Upgrade from 3.0 or later

:::note

The steps differ based on your cluster type. If you are unsure of your cluster type, look at the field `clusterManagementType` when you run `oc get installation -o yaml` before you proceed.

:::

1. Apply the updated manifests.

   ```bash
   oc apply --server-side --force-conflicts -f manifests/
   ```

1. <OpenShiftPrometheusOperator operation='upgrade' />

1. If your cluster is a management cluster, apply a [ManagementCluster](../../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.ManagementCluster)
   CR to your cluster.

   ```bash
   oc apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: ManagementCluster
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   EOF
   ```

1. If your cluster is v3.7 or older, apply a new [Monitor](../../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.Monitor)
   CR to your cluster.

   ```bash
   oc apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: Monitor
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   EOF
   ```

1. If your cluster is v3.16 or older, apply a new [PolicyRecommendation](../../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.PolicyRecommendation)
   CR to your cluster.

   ```bash
   oc apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: PolicyRecommendation
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   EOF
   ```

1. If your cluster was at one time v3.18 or older, remove deprecated fields from the [Manager](../../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.Manager).

   ```bash
   oc apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: Manager
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   EOF
   ```

1. If your cluster is v3.19 or older, apply a new [PacketCaptureAPI](../../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.PacketCaptureAPI)
    CR to your cluster.

   ```bash
   oc apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: PacketCaptureAPI
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   EOF
   ```

1. You can now monitor the upgrade progress with the following command:

   ```bash
   watch oc get tigerastatus
   ```

   :::note

   If there are any problems you can use `kubectl get tigerastatus -o yaml` to get more details.

   :::

1. Remove unused policies in your cluster.

   If your cluster is a **managed** cluster, run this command:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f $[filesUrl]/manifests/default-tier-policies-managed.yaml
   ```

   For other clusters, run this command:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f $[filesUrl]/manifests/default-tier-policies.yaml
   ```
