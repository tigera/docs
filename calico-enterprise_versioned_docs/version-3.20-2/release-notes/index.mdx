# Calico Enterprise 3.20 release notes

:::info early preview release

Calico Enterprise 3.20 can be used for previewing and testing purposes only.
It is not supported for use in production.

:::

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of {{prodname}}.

## New features and enhancements

### Support for OpenShift hosted control planes

You can now install Calico Enterprise on OpenShift clusters that use hosted control planes.

For more information, see [Installing Calico Enterprise on an OpenShift HCP cluster](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/openshift/hostedcontrolplanes.mdx)

### Packet capture and compliance reports are disabled by default

We've changed the default behavior for packet capturing and compliance reporting.
These features are now disabled by default.

:::note Update note
Updating to Calico Enterprise 3.20 will disable the packet capture and compliance reporting features.
To continue using these features, you must re-enable them during or after the update.
* **Multi-cluster management** You must enable compliance reports first in the management cluster, followed by the managed clusters.
* **PacketCapture CR** To maintain packet capture during an upgrade, you must create a PacketCaptureAPI custom resource.
* **Helm** Include the `packetcaptureAPI` and `compliance` flags in your `values.yaml` file to keep these features enabled during an update.
:::

For more information, see [Packet capture](../visibility/packetcapture.mdx), [Enable compliance reports](../compliance/enable-compliance.mdx), and [Upgrade Calico Enterprise installed with Helm](../getting-started/upgrading/upgrading-enterprise/kubernetes-upgrade-tsee/helm#upgrade-from-313-or-later).

## Deprecated and removed features

* All compliance reporting features are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  We're building a new compliance reporting system that will eventually replace the current one.
* The honeypods feature has been removed from this release.

## Bug fixes

* WAF events now include source information such as IP and namespace from where the event originated from.
* Fix that Felix would panic when trying to resync a temporary IP set. Temporary IP sets are created in certain scenarios after previous failures.

## Known issues

* Flow logs for the Windows workloads currently do not display entries with a Deny action.
* Before upgrading a {{prodname}} cluster on MKE v3.6 to the latest {{prodname}} version: 1) upgrade MKE from 3.6 to 3.7, then 2) upgrade {{prodname}}.
* L7 logs with source name `pvt` is not visible in Service Graph.
* Calico panics if kube-proxy or other components are using native `nftables` rules instead of the `iptables-nft` compatibility shim. Until Calico supports native nftables mode, we recommend that you continue to use the iptables-nft compatibility layer for all components. (The compatibility layer was the only option before Kubernetes v1.29 added alpha-level `nftables` support.) Do not run Calico in "legacy" iptables mode on a system that is also using `nftables`. Although this combination does not panic or fail (at least on kernels that support both), the interaction between `iptables` "legacy" mode and `nftables` is confusing: both `iptables` and `nftables` rules can be executed on the same packet, leading to policy verdicts being "overturned".
<li>Some application layer features are not working as expected for {{prodname}} installations with the following deployment types:
  <ul><li>AKS clusters with Azure CNI for networking and {{prodname}} for network policy</li>
    <li>RKE2 clusters installed with Rancher UI</li>
  </ul>
  During installation, for these deployment types, <code>kubeletVolumePluginPath</code> is set to <code>None</code> in the Installation CR, causing all application layer features to stop working.
  The affected features include web application firewalls, application layer policies, and L7 logging.
  As a workaround, you can restore the default value by running the following command on an affected cluster:
  <CodeBlock language='bash'>{`kubectl patch installation.tigera.io default --type=merge  -p '{"spec":{"kubeletVolumePluginPath":"/var/lib/kubelet"}}'`}</CodeBlock>
</li>

## Updating

:::important

{{prodname}} 3.20 contains breaking changes for installations that use the Calico API server.

:::

* ***Breaking change***: Upgrading from Calico Enterprise 3.18 or earlier {{prodname}} will alter the UID of all `projectcalico.org/v3` resources.
  If you're using the Calico API server, you must restart any controllers, including `kube-controller-manager`, that manage these resources after the upgrade.
  This change addresses an issue where duplicate UIDs on different API resources could disrupt Kubernetes garbage collection.
