# Calico Enterprise 3.20 release notes

:::info early preview release

Calico Enterprise 3.20 can be used for previewing and testing purposes only.
It is not supported for use in production.

:::

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of $[prodname].

## New features and enhancements

<!-- 3.20-2 -->

### Tech preview: network security for hosts and VMs

Calico can now be used on hosts and VMs running outside of Kubernetes.
This tech-preview provides RPM packages for RHEL 8 and 9 that allows users to install Calico for network policy and flow logs.

[Install Calico Enterprise on non-cluster hosts and VMs ](../getting-started/bare-metal/about.mdx)

### Search by policy name or namespace

$[prodname] now includes search-to-filter capabilities on the policy board and listing pages, which helps you find a specific policy or a subset of policies more quickly.

### Envoy deployment as a sidecar

$[prodname] now provides the ability to deploy Envoy as a sidecar so application layer policy and logging are compatible with other features such as egress gateways, Wireguard for data-in-transit encryption, and Calicoâ€™s eBPF dataplane.

For more information, see [Application layer policy](../network-policy/application-layer-policies/alp.mdx) and [L7 logs](../visibility/elastic/l7/configure.mdx).

### Configurable rules for deep packet inspection

$[prodname] now provides the ability for administrators to configure and customize the Snort rules that are used in deep packet inspection.
This gives customers greater control over the types of rules that are evaluated.
It also ensures that they can effectively tune and selectively enable rules to phase their deep packet inspection and network-based threat detection.

For more information, see [Deep packet inspection](../threat/deeppacketinspection.mdx).

### Calico early networking (for dual ToR) preserves post-boot default routes

$[prodname] includes improvements so that early network configuration will be superseded by any BGPPeer or BGPConfiguration resources after successful startup

For more information see [Deploy a dual ToR cluster](../networking/configuring/dual-tor.mdx).

### Other features

* Guardian will respect HTTP proxy environment variables when set on the deployment by mutating webhook configurations.
* Enhanced filtering options in the endpoints page of the Manager UI.

<!-- 3.20-1-->

### Support for OpenShift hosted control planes

You can now install Calico Enterprise on OpenShift clusters that use hosted control planes.

For more information, see [Installing Calico Enterprise on an OpenShift HCP cluster](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/openshift/hostedcontrolplanes.mdx)

### Packet capture and compliance reports are disabled by default

We've changed the default behavior for packet capturing and compliance reporting.
These features are now disabled by default.

:::note Update note
Updating to Calico Enterprise 3.20 will disable the packet capture and compliance reporting features.
To continue using these features, you must re-enable them during or after the update.
* **Multi-cluster management** You must enable compliance reports first in the management cluster, followed by the managed clusters.
* **PacketCapture CR** To maintain packet capture during an upgrade, you must create a PacketCaptureAPI custom resource.
* **Helm** Include the `packetcaptureAPI` and `compliance` flags in your `values.yaml` file to keep these features enabled during an update.
:::

For more information, see [Packet capture](../visibility/packetcapture.mdx), [Enable compliance reports](../compliance/enable-compliance.mdx), and [Upgrade Calico Enterprise installed with Helm](../getting-started/upgrading/upgrading-enterprise/kubernetes-upgrade-tsee/helm#upgrade-from-313-or-later).

## Deprecated and removed features

* All compliance reporting features are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  We're building a new compliance reporting system that will eventually replace the current one.
* The honeypods feature has been removed from this release.

## Bug fixes

* WAF events now include source information such as IP and namespace from where the event originated from.
* Fix that Felix would panic when trying to resync a temporary IP set. Temporary IP sets are created in certain scenarios after previous failures.
* Add tolerations for arm64 workloads for compatibility with GKE.
* Fixes an issue where the byte rates in the Dashboards page were inflated.
* Security updates.

## Known issues

* Flow logs for the Windows workloads currently do not display entries with a Deny action.
* Before upgrading a $[prodname] cluster on MKE v3.6 to the latest $[prodname] version: 1) upgrade MKE from 3.6 to 3.7, then 2) upgrade $[prodname].
* L7 logs with source name `pvt` is not visible in Service Graph.
* *Multi-cluster management users only*. If the `manager-tls` and `internal-manager-tls` secrets have overlapping DNS names, components such as `es-calico-kube-controllers` will log certificate errors. If you have previously installed a version older than v3.13.0 and never changed your manager-tls secret from the tigera-operator namespace, you must delete both of these secrets. This applies to you if the following command prints a certificate: `$ kubectl get secret manager-tls -n tigera-operator -o "jsonpath={.data['cert']}"`.
* *Multi-cluster management users only*. If the `manager-tls` and `internal-manager-tls` secrets have overlapping DNS names, components such as `es-calico-kube-controllers` will log certificate errors. If you have previously installed a version older than v3.13.0 and never changed your manager-tls secret from the tigera-operator namespace, you must delete both of these secrets. This applies to you if the following command prints a certificate: `$ kubectl get secret manager-tls -n tigera-operator -o "jsonpath={.data['cert']}"`.
* Upgrading to $[prodname] 3.18.0 on Rancher/RKE from $[prodname] 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed.
* Calico panics if kube-proxy or other components are using native `nftables` rules instead of the `iptables-nft` compatibility shim. Until Calico supports native nftables mode, we recommend that you continue to use the iptables-nft compatibility layer for all components. (The compatibility layer was the only option before Kubernetes v1.29 added alpha-level `nftables` support.) Do not run Calico in "legacy" iptables mode on a system that is also using `nftables`. Although this combination does not panic or fail (at least on kernels that support both), the interaction between `iptables` "legacy" mode and `nftables` is confusing: both `iptables` and `nftables` rules can be executed on the same packet, leading to policy verdicts being "overturned".
<li>
  Some application layer features are not working as expected for $[prodname] installations with the following deployment types:
  <ul>
    <li>AKS clusters with Azure CNI for networking and $[prodname] for network policy</li>
    <li>RKE2 clusters installed with Rancher UI</li>
  </ul>
  During installation, for these deployment types, <code>kubeletVolumePluginPath</code> is set to <code>None</code> in the Installation CR, causing all application layer features to stop working.
  The affected features include web application firewalls, application layer policies, and L7 logging.
  As a workaround, you can restore the default value by running the following command on an affected cluster:
  <CodeBlock language='bash'>{`kubectl patch installation.tigera.io default --type=merge  -p '{"spec":{"kubeletVolumePluginPath":"/var/lib/kubelet"}}'`}</CodeBlock>
</li>

* When using eBPF mode with kernels older than 5.17 you may need to set `bpfDNSPolicyMode` to `NoDelay` in the `FelixConfiguration` to avoid a  possible crash loop. Some distributions using kernel version < 5.17 may work depending on which backports are present in that kernel. For instance Ubuntu kernels 5.15+ and RH kernels 5.14+ have the necessary capabilities.

## Updating

:::important

$[prodname] 3.20 contains breaking changes for installations that use the Calico API server.

:::

* ***Breaking change:*** Upgrading from Calico Enterprise 3.18 or earlier $[prodname] will alter the UID of all `projectcalico.org/v3` resources.
  If you're using the Calico API server, you must restart any controllers, including `kube-controller-manager`, that manage these resources after the upgrade.
  This change addresses an issue where duplicate UIDs on different API resources could disrupt Kubernetes garbage collection.
