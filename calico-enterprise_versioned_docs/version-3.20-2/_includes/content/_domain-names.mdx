When a configured domain name has no wildcard (`*`), it matches exactly that domain name. For example:

- `microsoft.com`
- `tigera.io`

With a single asterisk in any part of the domain name, it matches 1 or more path components at that position. For example:

- `*.google.com` matches `www.google.com` and `www.ipv6.google.com`, but not `google.com`
- `www.*.com` matches `www.sun.com` and `www.apple.com`, but not `www.com`
- `update.*.mycompany.com` matches `update.tools.mycompany.com`, `update.secure.suite.mycompany.com`, and so on

**Not** supported are:

- Multiple wildcards in the same domain, for example: `*.*.mycompany.com`
- Asterisks that are not the entire component, for example: `www.g*.com`
- A wildcard as the last component, for example: `www.mycompany.*`
- More general wildcards, such as regular expressions
