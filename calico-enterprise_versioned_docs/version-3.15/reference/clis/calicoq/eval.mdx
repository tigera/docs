# calicoq eval

`calicoq eval <selector>` is used to display the endpoints that are matched by
`<selector>`.

## Examples

To find all endpoints that match the `role=='frontend'` selector, i.e. that
have a `role` label with value `frontend`:

```
calicoq eval "role=='frontend'"
```

Sample output follows.

```
Endpoints matching selector role=='frontend':
  Host endpoint webserver1/eth0
  Host endpoint webserver2/eth0
```

To find all endpoints that have an `app` label (with any value):

```
calicoq eval "has(app)"
```

Sample output follows.

```
Endpoints matching selector has(app):
  Workload endpoint rack1-host1/k8s/default.frontend-5gs43/eth0
```

(In this case the answer is a Kubernetes pod.)

To find endpoint for a selector that does not match any endpoints:

```
calicoq eval "role=='endfront'"
```

Sample output follows.

```
Endpoints matching selector role=='endfront':
```
