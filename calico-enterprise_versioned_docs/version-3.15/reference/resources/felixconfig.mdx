# Felix configuration

A [Felix](../architecture/overview.mdx#felix) configuration resource (`FelixConfiguration`) represents Felix configuration options for the cluster.

For `kubectl` commands, the following case-insensitive aliases may be used to specify the resource type on the CLI: `felixconfiguration.projectcalico.org`, `felixconfigurations.projectcalico.org` as well as abbreviations such as `felixconfiguration.p` and `felixconfigurations.p`.

See [Configuring Felix](../component-resources/node/felix/configuration.mdx) for more details.

## Sample YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: FelixConfiguration
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  ipv6Support: false
  ipipMTU: 1400
  chainInsertMode: Append
```

## Felix configuration definition

### Metadata

| Field | Description                                               | Accepted Values                                     | Schema |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| name  | Unique name to describe this resource instance. Required. | Alphanumeric string with optional `.`, `_`, or `-`. | string |

- {{prodname}} automatically creates a resource named `default` containing the global default configuration settings for Felix. You can use [calicoctl](../clis/calicoctl/overview.mdx) to view and edit these settings
- The resources with the name `node.<nodename>` contain the node-specific overrides, and will be applied to the node `<nodename>`. When deleting a node the FelixConfiguration resource associated with the node will also be deleted.

| awsSrcDstCheck                        | Controls automatically setting [source-destination-check](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html#EIP_Disable_SrcDestCheck) on an AWS EC2 instance running Felix. Setting the value to `Enable` will set the check value in the instance description to `true`. For `Disable`, the check value will be `false`. Setting must be `Disable` if you want the EC2 instance to process traffic not matching the host interface IP address. For example, EKS cluster using Calico CNI with `VXLANMode=CrossSubnet`. Check [IAM role and profile configuration](#aws-iam-rolepolicy-for-source-destination-check-configuration) for setting the necessary permission for this setting to work.                                    | DoNothing, Enable, Disable                                         | string                                  | `DoNothing`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| dropActionOverride                    | Controls what happens to each packet that is denied by the current {{prodname}} policy. Normally the `Drop` or `LogAndDrop` value should be used. However when experimenting or debugging a scenario that is not behaving as you expect, the `Accept` and `LogAndAccept` values can be useful: then the packet will be still be allowed through. When one of the `LogAnd...` values is set, each denied packet is logged in syslog.\*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `Drop`, `Accept`, `LogAndDrop`, `LogAndAccept`                     | string                                  | `Drop`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| chainInsertMode                       | Controls whether Felix hooks the kernel's top-level iptables chains by inserting a rule at the top of the chain or by appending a rule at the bottom. `Insert` is the safe default since it prevents {{prodname}}'s rules from being bypassed. If you switch to `Append` mode, be sure that the other rules in the chains signal acceptance by falling through to the {{prodname}} rules, otherwise the {{prodname}} policy will be bypassed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `Insert`, `Append`                                                 | string                                  | `Insert`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| defaultEndpointToHostAction           | This parameter controls what happens to traffic that goes from a workload endpoint to the host itself (after the traffic hits the endpoint egress policy). By default {{prodname}} blocks traffic from workload endpoints to the host itself with an iptables "DROP" action. If you want to allow some or all traffic from endpoint to host, set this parameter to `Return` or `Accept`. Use `Return` if you have your own rules in the iptables "INPUT" chain; {{prodname}} will insert its rules at the top of that chain, then `Return` packets to the "INPUT" chain once it has completed processing workload endpoint egress policy. Use `Accept` to unconditionally accept packets from workloads after processing workload endpoint egress policy. | Drop, Return, Accept                                               | string                                  | `Drop`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| interfaceExclude                      | A comma-separated list of interface names that should be excluded when Felix is resolving host endpoints. The default value ensures that Felix ignores Kubernetes' internal `kube-ipvs0` device. If you want to exclude multiple interface names using a single value, the list supports regular expressions. For regular expressions you must wrap the value with `/`. For example having values `/^kube/,veth1` will exclude all interfaces that begin with `kube` and also the interface `veth1`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | string                                                             | string                                  | `kube-ipvs0`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| iptablesNATOutgoingInterfaceFilter    | This parameter can be used to limit the host interfaces on which Calico will apply SNAT to traffic leaving a Calico IPAM pool with "NAT outgoing" enabled. This can be useful if you have a main data interface, where traffic should be SNATted and a secondary device (such as the docker bridge) which is local to the host and doesn't require SNAT. This parameter uses the iptables interface matching syntax, which allows `+` as a wildcard. Most users will not need to set this. Example: if your data interfaces are eth0 and eth1 and you want to exclude the docker bridge, you could set this to `eth+`                                                                                                                                     | string                                                             | string                                  | `""`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| ipsecAllowUnsecuredTraffic            | When set to `false`, only IPsec-protected traffic will be allowed on the packet paths where IPsec is supported. When set to `true`, IPsec will be used but non-IPsec traffic will be accepted. In general, setting this to `true` is less safe since it allows an attacker to inject packets. However, it is useful when transitioning from non-IPsec to IPsec since it allows traffic to flow while the cluster negotiates the IPsec mesh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `true`, `false`                                                    | boolean                                 | `false`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| flowLogsFileEnabled                   | Set to `true`, enables flow logs. If set to `false` no flow logging will occur. Flow logs are written to a file `flows.log` and sent to Elasticsearch. The location of this file can be configured using the `flowLogsFileDirectory` field. File rotation settings for this `flows.log` file can be configured using the fields `flowLogsFileMaxFiles` and `flowLogsFileMaxFileSizeMB`. Note that flow log exports to Elasticsearch are dependent on flow logs getting written to this file. Setting this parameter to `false` will disable flow logs.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `true`, `false`                                                    | boolean                                 | `false`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| dnsTrustedServers                     | The DNS servers that Felix should trust. Each entry here must be `<ip>[:<port>]` - indicating an explicit DNS server IP - or `k8s-service:[<namespace>/]<name>[:port]` - indicating a Kubernetes DNS service. `<port>` defaults to the first service port, or 53 for an IP, and `<namespace>` to `kube-system`. An IPv6 address with a port must use the square brackets convention, for example `[fd00:83a6::12]:5353`. Note that Felix (calico-node) will need RBAC permission to read the details of each service specified by a `k8s-service:...` form.                                                                                                                                                                                               | IPs or service names                                               | comma-separated strings                 | `k8s-service:kube-dns`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| dnsLogsFileEnabled                    | Set to `true`, enables DNS logs. If set to `false` no DNS logging will occur. DNS logs are written to a file `dns.log` and sent to Elasticsearch. The location of this file can be configured using the `DNSLogsFileDirectory` field. File rotation settings for this `dns.log` file can be configured using the fields `DNSLogsFileMaxFiles` and `DNSLogsFileMaxFileSizeMB`. Note that DNS log exports to Elasticsearch are dependent on DNS logs getting written to this file. Setting this parameter to `false` will disable DNS logs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `true`, `false`                                                    | boolean                                 | `false`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

In DSR mode, traffic is tunneled to the host with the backing pod and then returned directly; this requires a network that allows direct return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Tunnel,DSR                                                         | string                                  | Tunnel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| routeSource                           | Where Felix gets is routing information from for VXLAN and the BPF dataplane. The CalicoIPAM setting is more efficient because it supports route aggregation, but it only works when Calico's IPAM or host-local IPAM is in use. Use the WorkloadIPs setting if you are using Calico's VXLAN or BPF dataplane and not using Calico IPAM or host-local IPAM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | CalicoIPAM,WorkloadIPs                                             | string                                  | `CalicoIPAM`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

\* When `dropActionOverride` is set to `LogAndDrop` or `LogAndAccept`, the `syslog` entries look something like the following.

```
May 18 18:42:44 ubuntu kernel: [ 1156.246182] calico-drop: IN=tunl0 OUT=cali76be879f658 MAC= SRC=192.168.128.30 DST=192.168.157.26 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=62 ID=56743 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=56248 DPT=80 WINDOW=29200 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 MARK=0xa000000
```

\*\* Duration is denoted by the numerical amount followed by the unit of time. Valid units of time include nanoseconds (ns), microseconds (µs), milliseconds (ms), seconds (s), minutes (m), and hours (h). Units of time can also be used together e.g. `3m30s` to represent 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Any amounts of time that can be converted into larger units of time will be converted e.g. `90s` will become `1m30s`.

`genericXDPEnabled` and `xdpRefreshInterval` are only relevant when `bpfEnabled` is `false` and
`xdpEnabled` is `true`; in other words when XDP is being used to accelerate denial-of-service
prevention policies in the iptables dataplane.

When `bpfEnabled` is `true` the "xdp" settings all have no effect; in BPF mode the implementation of
policy is always accelerated, using the best available BPF technology.

### Health Timeout Overrides

Felix has internal liveness and readiness watchdog timers that monitor its various loops.
If a loop fails to "check in" within the allotted timeout then Felix will report non-Ready
or non-Live on its health port (which is monitored by Kubelet in a Kubernetes system).
If Felix reports non-Live, this can result in the Pod being restarted.

In Kubernetes, if you see the calico-node Pod readiness or liveness checks fail
intermittently, check the calico-node Pod log for a log from Felix that gives the
overall health status (the list of components will depend on which features are enabled):

```
+---------------------------+---------+----------------+-----------------+--------+
|         COMPONENT         | TIMEOUT |    LIVENESS    |    READINESS    | DETAIL |
+---------------------------+---------+----------------+-----------------+--------+
| CalculationGraph          | 30s     | reporting live | reporting ready |        |
| FelixStartup              | 0s      | reporting live | reporting ready |        |
| InternalDataplaneMainLoop | 1m30s   | reporting live | reporting ready |        |
+---------------------------+---------+----------------+-----------------+--------+
```

If some health timeouts show as "timed out" it may help to apply an override
using the `healthTimeoutOverrides` field:

```yaml noValidation
...
spec:
  healthTimeoutOverrides:
  - name: InternalDataplaneMainLoop
    timeout: "5m"
  - name: CalculationGraph
    timeout: "1m30s"
  ...
```

A timeout value of 0 disables the timeout.

| DelayDeniedPacket | Felix delays any denied packet that traversed a policy that included egress domain matches, but did not match. The packet is released after a fixed time, or after the destination IP address was programmed.                                                                                                                 |
| DelayDNSResponse  | Felix delays any DNS response until related IPSets are programmed. This introduces some latency to all DNS packets (even when no IPSet programming is required), but it ensures policy hit statistics are accurate. This is the recommended setting when you are making use of staged policies or policy rule hit statistics. |
| NoDelay           | Felix does not introduce any delay to the packets. DNS rules may not have been programmed by the time the first packet traverses the policy rules. Client applications need to handle reconnection attempts if initial connection attempts fail. This may be problematic for some applications or for very low DNS TTLs.      |

On Windows, or when using the eBPF dataplane, this setting is ignored and `NoDelay` is always used.

A linux kernel version of 3.13 or greater is required to use `DelayDNSResponse`. For earlier kernel versions, this value is modified to `DelayDeniedPacket`.

### RouteTableRange

The `RouteTableRange` option is now deprecated in favor of [RouteTableRanges](#routetableranges).

| Field | Description          | Accepted Values | Schema |
| ----- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------ |
| min   | Minimum index to use | 1-250           | int    |
| max   | Maximum index to use | 1-250           | int    |

### RouteTableRanges

`RouteTableRanges` is a list of `RouteTableRange` objects:

| Field | Description          | Accepted Values | Schema |
| ----- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------ |
| min   | Minimum index to use | 1 - 4294967295  | int    |
| max   | Maximum index to use | 1 - 4294967295  | int    |

Each item in the `RouteTableRanges` list designates a range of routing tables available to Calico. By default, Calico will use a single range of `1-250`. If a range spans Linux's reserved table range (`253-255`) then those tables are automatically excluded from the list. It's possible that other table ranges may also be reserved by third-party systems unknown to Calico. In that case, multiple ranges can be defined to target tables below and above the sensitive ranges:

```sh
 target tables 65-99, and 256-1000, skipping 100-255
calicoctl patch felixconfig default --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"routeTableRanges": [{"min": 65, "max": 99}, {"min": 256, "max": 1000}] }}
```

_Note_, for performance reasons, the maximum total number of routing tables that Felix will accept is 65535 (or 2\*16).

Specifying both the `RouteTableRange` and `RouteTableRanges` arguments is not supported and will result in an error from the api.

### AWS IAM Role/Policy for source-destination-check configuration

Setting `awsSrcDstCheck` to `Disable` will automatically disable source-destination-check on EC2 instances in a cluster, provided necessary IAM roles and policies are set. One of the policies assigned to IAM role of cluster nodes must contain a statement similar to the following:

```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "ec2:DescribeInstances",
            "ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute"
        ],
    "Resource": "*"
}
```

If there are no policies attached to node roles containing the above statement, attach a new policy. For example, if a node role is `test-cluster-nodeinstance-role`, click on the IAM role in AWS console. In the `Permission policies` list, add a new inline policy with the above statement to the new policy JSON definition. For detailed information, see [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console).

For an EKS cluster, the necessary IAM role and policy is available by default. No further actions are needed.
