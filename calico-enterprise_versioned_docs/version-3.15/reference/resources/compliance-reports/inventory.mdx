# Inventory report

To create an Inventory report, create a [`GlobalReport`](../globalreport.mdx) with the `reportType`
set to `inventory`.

The following sample command creates a GlobalReport that results in a daily inventory report for
endpoints in the `public` namespace.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata:
  name: daily-public-inventory-report
  labels:
    deployment: production
spec:
  reportType: inventory
  endpoints:
    namespaces:
      names:
        - public
  schedule: 0 0 * * *
EOF
```
