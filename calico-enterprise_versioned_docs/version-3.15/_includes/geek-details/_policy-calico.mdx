Kubernetes network policies are implemented by network plugins rather than Kubernetes itself. Simply creating a network policy resource without a network plugin to implement it, will have no effect on network traffic.

The {{prodname}} plugin implements the full set of Kubernetes network policy features. In addition, {{prodname}} supports {{prodname}} network policies, providing additional features and capabilities beyond Kubernetes network policies. Kubernetes and {{prodname}} network policies work together seamlessly, so you can choose whichever is right for you, and mix and match as desired.
