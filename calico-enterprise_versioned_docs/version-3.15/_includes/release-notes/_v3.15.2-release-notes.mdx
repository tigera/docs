### Improvements

- Fixed performance issues with listing/resyncing routes when there many interfaces/routes on the system.  Use kernel-side filtering of routes for a dramatic speed improvement. (Auto-enabled on kernel v4.10+.)

- Added tolerations to CSI Driver so it can be scheduled on all nodes.

- Added a missing policy between Guardian and the Apiserver that could cause issues in multi-cluster installations if a global default deny policy is active.

- Fixed an issue where the operator made many meaningless policy updates, resulting in bloated policy details in the UI.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug that caused policies to show in the service graph for even if they were deleted before the selected time range.
- Fixed an issue where publicly-signed Splunk certificates were not trusted.
- Fixed a bug that caused policy preview to crash due to a malformed query.
- Fixed a bug that caused Anomaly Detection jobs to fail if incompletele documents are present in our log storage.

### Known issues

- L7 log collection fails to deploy on CIS hardened clusters. As a result, some cards in the manager UI dashboard will not display any metrics.
- Upgrading {{prodname}} v3.15.1 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} v3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
