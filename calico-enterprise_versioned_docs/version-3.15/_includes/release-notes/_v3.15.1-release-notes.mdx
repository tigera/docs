### Improvements

- Adding graceful shutdown to Typha improves the "happy case" for upgrade, ensuring that shutting down a Typha instance
  doesn't cause a thundering herd of `calico-node` subcomponent restarts. Instead, clients are disconnected slowly over a
  configured interval, thus limiting the rate of `calico-node` subcomponent restarts.
- Combining graceful restart with new configuration exposed by the operator allows for the Typha deployment's `maxSurge`
  and `maxUnavailable` settings to be tuned. Setting `maxSurge: "100%"` and `maxUnavailable: 0` means that all up-level
  Typha instances will start and reach `Ready` before their back-level counterpart is then (gracefully) shut down.
  (For back-compatibility, the default values of `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` have been kept as-is in this release
  but the upgrade guide explains how to set these during an upgrade.)
- To mitigate the "unhappy case" where many `calico-node` instances restart at once (for any reason), Typha's handling
  of new connections has been improved to share much of the work between different clients, this dramatically improves
  performance when dealing with a "thundering herd".
- Updated TLS configurations to use only TLS1.2.
- The images for FlexVolume, CSI, Node Driver Registrar are now pulled from our private `quay.io` registry.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug causing Calico Node to restart during upgrades when upgrading from v3.10 and before, due to the  
  addition of the TPROXYMode setting in the Felix Configuration resource.
- Fixed a bug causing liveness checks to fail for Calico Node during upgrades, due to changed field names in TLS secrets.
- Fixed a bug that prevented [controlPlaneNodeSelector](../../reference/installation/api.mdx#operator.tigera.io/v1.InstallationSpec)
  from being propagated to Prometheus and Alertmanager.
- Fixed a bug that caused Intrusion Detection Controller to restart whenever a managed cluster would disconnect.
- CVE updates, most notably: updating our scratch based images to UBI 8.7, golang versions 1.18.9 or 1.19.5, ECK 2.5.0, Elasticsearch 7.17.7, Kibana 7.17.7.
- Fixed a bug that prevented federated services from working for OpenShift

### Known issues

- L7 log collection fails to deploy on CIS hardened clusters. As a result, some cards in the manager UI dashboard will not display any metrics.
- Upgrading {variables.prodname} v3.15.1 on Rancher/RKE from {variables.prodname} v3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
