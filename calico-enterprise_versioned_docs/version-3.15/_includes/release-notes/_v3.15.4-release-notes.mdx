### Improvements

- Added federation metrics to Typha, similar to our current federation metrics in kube-controllers.

### Bug fixes

- v3.15.4 contains security updates.
- Fixed DNS policy when DNS responses are larger than around 1024 bytes and the Linux kernel is 4.8 or later.
- Fixed an issue where the use of subPath in a volumeMount could prevent pod creation on Windows when Docker is the runtime.
- Added a decoupling buffer between the Typha client library and downstream code. This prevents the Typha client from being blocked if the downstream code blocks for too long, and prevents timeouts at very high scale.

### Known issues

- L7 log collection fails to deploy on CIS-hardened clusters. As a result, some cards in the manager UI dashboard will not display any metrics.
- Upgrading {{prodname}} v3.15.4 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} v3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
