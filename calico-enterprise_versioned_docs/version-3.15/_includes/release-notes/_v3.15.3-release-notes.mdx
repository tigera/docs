### Improvements

- Egress gateways will attempt to auto-detect the iptables backend, preferring `nft` if available
- Updated rbac.authorization.k8s.io apiVersion to v1
- Updated golang to 1.20.4 and updated other dependencies to remove CVEs

### Bug fixes

None

### Known issues

- L7 log collection fails to deploy on CIS-hardened clusters. As a result, some cards in the manager UI dashboard will not display any metrics.
- Upgrading {variables.prodname} v3.15.3 on Rancher/RKE from {variables.prodname} v3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
