Many `{{ include.cli }}` commands require access to the {{prodname}} datastore. In most
circumstances, `{{ include.cli }}` cannot achieve this connection by default. You can provide
`{{ include.cli }}` with the information it needs using either of the following.

1. **Configuration file**: by default, `{{ include.cli }}` will look for a configuration file
   at `/etc/calico/{{include.cli}}.cfg`. You can override this using the `--config` option with
   commands that require datastore access. The file can be in either YAML or JSON format.
   It must be valid and readable by `{{ include.cli }}`. A YAML example follows.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: CalicoAPIConfig
   metadata:
   spec:
     datastoreType: "kdd"
     ...
   ```

1. **Environment variables**: If `{{ include.cli }}` cannot locate, read, or access a configuration
   file, it will check a specific set of environment variables.

See the section that corresponds to your [datastore type](../../operations/clis/index.mdx) for a full set of options
and examples.

:::note

When running `{{ include.cli }}` inside a container, any environment variables and
configuration files must be passed to the container so they are available to
the process inside. It can be useful to keep a running container (that sleeps) configured
for your datastore, then it is possible to `exec` into the container and have an
already configured environment.
