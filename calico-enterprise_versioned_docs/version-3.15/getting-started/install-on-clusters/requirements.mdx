# System requirements

<ReqsSys orch='Kubernetes' />

## CNI plug-in enabled

For Kubernetes 1.24 or later, {variables.prodname} must be installed as a CNI plugin in the container runtime.

This installation must use the Kubernetes default CNI configuration directory (`/etc/cni/net.d`) and binary directory (`/opt/cni/bin`).

For Kubernetes 1.23 or earlier, the kubelet must be configured to use CNI networking by passing the `--network-plugin=cni` argument.
(On kubeadm, this is the default.)

## Other network providers

Generally, you can not use {variables.prodname} together with another network provider.

Notable exceptions include certain platform-specific CNIs, such as the [AWS VPC CNI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/blob/master/README.md) and [Azure VNET CNI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md) plugins.

If you're working with a cluster that already uses another CNI, you can not migrate to {variables.prodname}.

## Supported kube-proxy modes

{variables.prodname} supports the following kube-proxy modes:

- `iptables` (default)

### IP pool configuration

The IP range selected for pod IP addresses cannot overlap with any other
IP ranges in your network, including:

- The Kubernetes service cluster IP range
- The range from which host IPs are allocated
