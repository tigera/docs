# BGP logs

{{prodname}} pushes BGP activity logs to Elasticsearch. To view them, go to the Discovery view, and from the dropdown menu, select `tigera_secure_ee_bgp.*` to view the collected BIRD and BIRD6 logs.

The following table details key/value pairs for constructing queries, including their Elasticsearch datatype.

| Name         | Datatype | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `logtime`    | date     | When the log was collected in UTC timestamp format.                                                                                                           |
| `host`       | keyword  | The name of the node where log was collected.                                                                                                                 |
| `ip_version` | keyword  | Contains one of the following values:<br/>&#x25cf;&nbsp;<code>IPv4</code>: Log from BIRD process <br/>&#x25cf;&nbsp;<code>IPv6</code>: Log from BIRD6 process |
| `message`    | text     | The message contained in the log.                                                                                                                             |

Once a set of BGP logs has accumulated in Elasticsearch, you can perform many interesting queries. Depending on the field that you want to query, different techniques are required. For example:

- To view BGP logs only for IPv4 or IPv6, query on the `ip_version` field and sort by `logtime`
- To see all logs from a specific node, query on the `host` field
- To view events in the cluster, query on the `message` field
