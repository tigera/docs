# Configure DNS logs

{variables.prodname} pushes DNS activity logs to Elasticsearch, for DNS information that is obtained from [trusted DNS servers](../../../network-policy/domain-based-policy.mdx#trusted-dns-servers). The following table
details the key/value pairs in the JSON blob, including their
[Elasticsearch datatype](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-types.html).
This information should assist you in constructing queries.

The `latency_*` fields provide information about the latency of the DNS lookups that contributed to
this log. For each successful DNS lookup {variables.prodname} measures the time between when the DNS
request was sent and when the corresponding DNS response was received.

## Querying on various DNS log fields

Once a set of DNS logs has accumulated in Elasticsearch, you can perform many interesting queries. For example:

- with a query on the `qname` field, you could find all of the DNS response information that was
  provided to clients trying to resolve a particular domain name

- with a query on the `rrsets.rdata` field, you could find all of the DNS lookups that included a
  particular IP address in their response data.

Different techniques are needed, depending on the field that you want to query on.

### Querying on a top-level field

A top-level field is any of those in the first table above. Querying on a top-level field is
supported in the Kibana web UI and can also be done with the Elasticsearch API, for example:

```shell
curl 'http://10.111.1.235:9200/tigera_secure_ee_dns.cluster.20190711/_search?q=qname:example.com&pretty=true'
```

Please note that, to try this and the following examples in your own cluster:

- You should replace the IP address (here `10.111.1.235`) with the cluster IP of the Elasticsearch
  API service in your cluster (which you can see with `kubectl get svc --all-namespaces -o wide`).

- You should replace the `cluster` and date parts of the full index name (here
  `tigera_secure_ee_dns.cluster.20190711`) with the configured cluster name in your cluster and
  the date of the data that you want to search
  through. The cluster name can be retrieved from the `clusterName` field in the ConfigMap
  retrieved with `kubectl get configmap -n tigera-operator tigera-secure-elasticsearch -o yaml`.

- You will need to run curl from a host or pod that is allowed by {variables.prodname} policy to
  connect to the Elasticsearch API service. In our non-production demo setup
  (`monitor-calico.yaml`), the fluentd pods have such access, so you can use `kubectl get po -n tigera-fluentd` to find the name of a fluentd pod and then `kubectl exec <fluentd pod name> -n tigera-fluentd -- curl ...` to perform the query.

Note that that query can also be written with a JSON body, like this:

```shell
curl 'http://10.111.1.235:9200/tigera_secure_ee_dns.cluster.20190711/_search?pretty=true' \
    -d '{"query": {"match": {"qname": "example.com"}}}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Querying on a nested object field

A nested object field is one of those in the second and third tables above, i.e. within the `rrsets`
and `servers` objects. Querying on a nested object field is not supported by Kibana, but can be
done with the Elasticsearch API, for example:

```shell
curl 'http://10.111.1.235:9200/tigera_secure_ee_dns.cluster.20190711/_search?pretty=true' \
    -d '{"size": 2, "query": {"nested": {"path": "rrsets", "query": {"match": {"rrsets.rdata": "18.103.110.45"}}}}}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
