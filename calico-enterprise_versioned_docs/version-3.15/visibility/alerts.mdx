# Manage alerts

## Big picture

Manage alerts and alert events for {{prodname}} features.

## Value

You can configure alerts for many {{prodname}} features. Alerts are critical to teams for different reasons, for example:

- **Visibility and troubleshooting** - alerts may indicate infrastructure problems, application bugs, or performance degradation
- **Security** - alerts on suspicious traffic or workload behavior may indicate a compromise or malicious actor

You can manage alerts and alert events in Manager UI, or using the CLI. {{prodname}} also provides alert templates
for common tasks that you can rename and edit to suit your own needs.

## Before you begin

**Recommended**

We recommend turning down the aggregation level for flow logs to ensure that you see pod-specific results. {{prodname}} aggregates flow logs over the external IPs for allowed traffic, and alert events will not provide pod-specific results (unless the traffic is denied by policy).

To turn down agregation on flow logs, go to [FelixConfiguration](../reference/resources/felixconfig.mdx) and set the field, **flowLogsFileAggregationKindForAllowed** to **1**.

- [Manage alerts using CLI](#manage-alerts-using-cli)

### Manage alerts in Manager UI

You can view alert events in Manager UI in several places: the **Alerts** page, **Service Graph**, and the **Kibana** dashboard.

Click **Activity**, **Alerts** to follow along.

**Alerts page**

The Alerts page lists **alert events** that are generated by alerts that you’ve configured. (A list of Alerts can be found by clicking the **Alert configuration** icon).

![alerts-list](/img/calico-enterprise/alerts-list.png)

You can create alerts for many {{prodname}} features. Although the following list of features is not exhaustive and will grow, you get a sense of the range of alerts that can be displayed on this page.

- {{prodname}} logs from Elasticsearch (flow, dns, audit, bgp, L7)
- Anomaly detection
- Honeypods
- Deep packet inspection (DPI)
- Threat defense (suspicious IPs, suspicious domains)
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Note the following:

- The alert event list will be empty until you configure alerts for a feature
- You can dismiss alert events from view using the checkboxes or bulk action
- The list may contain alert events that are identical or nearly identical. For nearly identical events, you can see differences in the `record` field when you expand the event.
- Because alert events share the same interface, fields that do not apply to the alert are noted by “N/A”
- You can filter alert events by Type.

  ![filter-alerts](/img/calico-enterprise/filter-alerts.png)

  Note these types:

  - **Custom** - filters legacy global alert events that were created before v3.12
  - **Global Alert** - includes alerts for {{prodname}} Elasticsearch logs (audit, dns, flow, L7, WAF)

**Add/edit/delete alerts**

To manage alerts, click the **Alerts Configuration** icon.

The following alert is an example of a global alert in the list view. This sample alert generates alert events when there are 100 flows in the cluster in the last 5 mins. (The YAML version of this alert is shown in the section on using the [CLI](#examples).)

![alert-list-view](/img/calico-enterprise/alert-list-view.png)

To create a new alert, click the **New** drop-down menu, and select **Blank**.

Global alerts use a domain-specific query language to select records from a data set to use in the alert. You can also select/omit specific namespaces.

![alert-example-ui](/img/calico-enterprise/alert-example-ui.png)

For help with fields on this page, see [GlobalAlert](../reference/resources/globalalert.mdx).

**Alert templates**

From the **New** drop-down menu, select **Template**.

![alert-template](/img/calico-enterprise/alert-template.png)

The template list contains alerts for common tasks created by {{prodname}}. With templates you can:

- Update and rename an existing template
- Create a new template from scratch
- Create a new alert and save it as a template

### Manage alerts using CLI

This section provides examples of how to create and delete global alerts using `kubectl` and YAMLs.

**Create a global alert**

1. Create a YAML file with one or more alerts.
1. Apply the alert to your cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <your_alert_filename>
   ```

1. Wait until the alert runs and check the status.

   ```bash
   kubectl get globalalert <your_alert_name> -o yaml
   ```

1. In Manager UI, go to the **Alerts** page to view alert events.

### Examples

The following alert generates alert events when there are 100 flows in the cluster in the last 5 mins.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalAlert
metadata:
  name: example-flows
spec:
  description: '100 flows Example'
  summary: 'Flows example ${count} > 100'
  severity: 100
  dataSet: flows
  metric: count
  condition: gt
  threshold: 100
```

The following alert generates alert events when there is ssh traffic in the default namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalAlert
metadata:
  name: network.ssh
spec:
  description: 'ssh flows to default namespace'
  summary: '[flows] ssh flow in default namespace detected from ${source_namespace}/${source_name_aggr}'
  severity: 100
  period: 10m
  lookback: 10m
  dataSet: flows
  query: proto='tcp' AND action='allow' AND dest_port='22' AND (source_namespace='default' OR dest_namespace='default') AND reporter=src
  aggregateBy: [source_namespace, source_name_aggr]
  field: num_flows
  metric: sum
  condition: gt
  threshold: 0
```

The following alert generates alert events when {{prodname}} globalnetworksets are modified.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalAlert
metadata:
  name: policy.globalnetworkset
spec:
  description: 'Changed globalnetworkset'
  summary: '[audit] [privileged access] change detected for ${objectRef.resource} ${objectRef.name}'
  severity: 100
  period: 10m
  lookback: 10m
  dataSet: audit
  query: (verb=create OR verb=update OR verb=delete OR verb=patch) AND "objectRef.resource"=globalnetworksets
  aggregateBy: [objectRef.resource, objectRef.name]
  metric: count
  condition: gt
  threshold: 0
```

The following alert generates alert events for all flow from processes in the data set.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalAlert
metadata:
  name: example-process-set-embedded
spec:
  description: Generate alerts for all flows from processes in the set
  summary: Generate alerts for all flows from processes in the set
  severity: 100
  dataSet: flows
  query: process_name IN {"python?", "*checkoutservice"}
```

The following example generates alert events for DNS lookups that are not in the allowed domain set. Because this set can be potentially large, a variable is used in the query string and is referenced in the substitutions list.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalAlert
metadata:
  name: example-domain-set-variable
spec:
  description: Generate alerts for all DNS lookups not in the domain set
  summary: Generate alerts for all DNS lookups not in the domain set with variable
  severity: 100
  dataSet: dns
  query: qname NOTIN ${domains}
  substitutions:
    - name: domains
      values:
        - '*cluster.local'
        - '?.mydomain.com'
```

**Delete a global alert**

To delete a global alert and stop all alert event generation, use the following command.

```bash
kubectl delete globalalert <global-alert-name>
```
