# Configure DNS logs

$[prodname] pushes DNS activity logs to Elasticsearch, for DNS information that is obtained from [trusted DNS servers](../../../network-policy/domain-based-policy.mdx#trusted-dns-servers). The following table
details the key/value pairs in the JSON blob, including their
[Elasticsearch datatype](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-types.html).
This information should assist you in constructing queries.

The `latency_*` fields provide information about the latency of the DNS lookups that contributed to
this log. For each successful DNS lookup $[prodname] measures the time between when the DNS
request was sent and when the corresponding DNS response was received.

## Query DNS log fields

After a set of DNS logs has accumulated in Elasticsearch, you can perform many interesting queries. For example, if you query on:

- `qname`, you can find all of the DNS response information that was provided to clients trying to resolve a particular domain name

- `rrsets.rdata`, you can find all of the DNS lookups that included a particular IP address in their response data.
