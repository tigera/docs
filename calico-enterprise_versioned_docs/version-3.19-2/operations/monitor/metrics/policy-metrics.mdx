# Policy metrics

{{prodname}} adds the ability to monitor effects of policies configured in your cluster.
By defining a set of simple rules and thresholds, you can monitor traffic metrics and receive
alerts when it exceeds configured thresholds.

Policy inspection and reporting is accomplished using four key pieces:

- A {{prodname}} specific Felix binary running inside `{{noderunning}}` container
  monitors the host for denied/allowed packets and collects metrics.
- Prometheus Server(s) deployed as part of the {{prodname}} manifest scrapes
  every configured `{{noderunning}}` target. Alerting rules querying denied packet
  metrics are configured in Prometheus and when triggered, fire alerts to
  the Prometheus Alertmanager.
- Prometheus Alertmanager (or simply Alertmanager), deployed as part of
  the {{prodname}} manifest, receives alerts from Prometheus and forwards
  alerts to various alerting mechanisms such as _Pager Duty_, or _OpsGenie_.
- {{prodname}} Manager, also deployed as part of the {{prodname}} manifest,
  processes the metrics using pre-defined Prometheus queries and provides dashboards and associated workflows.

Metrics will only be generated at a node when there are packets directed at an endpoint that are being actively profiled by a policy.
Once generated they stay alive for 60 seconds.

Once Prometheus scrapes a node and collects policy metrics, it will be
available at Prometheus until the metric is considered _stale_, i.e.,
Prometheus has not seen any updates to this metric for some time. This time is
configurable. Refer to
[Configuring Prometheus configuration](../prometheus/index.mdx)
for more information.

Because of metrics being expired, as just described, it is entirely possible
for a GET on a metrics query URL to return no information. This is expected
if there have not been any packets being processed by a policy on that node, in
the last 60 seconds.

Metrics generated by each {{prodname}} node are:

- `calico_denied_packets` - Total number of packets denied by {{prodname}} policies.
- `calico_denied_bytes` - Total number of bytes denied by {{prodname}} policies.
- `cnx_policy_rule_packets` - Sum of allowed/denied packets over rules processed by
  {{prodname}} policies.
- `cnx_policy_rule_bytes` - Sum of allowed/denied bytes over rules processed by
  {{prodname}} policies.
- `cnx_policy_rule_connections` - Sum of connections over rules processed by {{prodname}}
  policies.

The metrics `calico_denied_packets` and `calico_denied_bytes` have the labels `policy` and `srcIP`.
Using these two metrics, one can identify the policy that denied packets as well as
the source IP address of the packets that were denied by this policy. Using
Prometheus terminology, `calico_denied_packets` is the metric name and `policy`
and `srcIP` are labels. Each one of these metrics will be available as a
combination of `{policy, srcIP}`.

Example queries:

- Total number of bytes, denied by {{prodname}} policies, originating from the IP address "10.245.13.133"
  by `k8s_ns.ns-0` profile.

```
calico_denied_bytes{policy="profile|k8s_ns.ns-0|0|deny", srcIP="10.245.13.133"}
```

- Total number of packets denied by {{prodname}} policies, originating from the IP address "10.245.13.149"
  by `k8s_ns.ns-0` profile.

```
calico_denied_packets{policy="profile|k8s_ns.ns-0|0|deny", srcIP="10.245.13.149"}}
```

The metrics `cnx_policy_rule_packets`, `cnx_policy_rule_bytes` and `cnx_policy_rule_connections` have the
labels: `tier`, `policy`, `namespace`, `rule_index`, `action`, `traffic_direction`, `rule_direction`.

Using these metrics, one can identify allow, and denied byte rate and packet rate, both inbound and outbound, indexed by both policy and rule. {{prodname}} Manager Dashboard makes heavy usage of these metrics.
Staged policy names are prefixed with "staged:".

Example queries:

- Query counts for rules: Packet rates for specific rule by traffic_direction

```
sum(irate(cnx_policy_rule_packets{namespace="namespace-2",policy="policy-0",rule_direction="ingress",rule_index="rule-5",tier="tier-0"}[30s])) without (instance)
```

- Query counts for rules: Packet rates for each rule in a policy by traffic_direction

```
sum(irate(cnx_policy_rule_packets{namespace="namespace-2",policy="policy-0",tier="tier-0"}[30s])) without (instance)
```

- Query counts for a single policy by traffic_direction and action

```
sum(irate(cnx_policy_rule_packets{namespace="namespace-2",policy="policy-0",tier="tier-0"}[30s])) without (instance,rule_index,rule_direction)
```

- Query counts for all policies across all tiers by traffic_direction and action

```
sum(irate(cnx_policy_rule_packets[30s])) without (instance,rule_index,rule_direction)
```

See the
[Felix configuration reference](../../../reference/component-resources/node/felix/configuration.mdx#calico-enterprise-specific-configuration) for
the settings that control the reporting of these metrics. {{prodname}} manifests
normally set `PrometheusReporterEnabled=true` and
`PrometheusReporterPort=9081`, so these metrics are available on each compute
node at `http://<node-IP>:9081/metrics`.
