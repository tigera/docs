## Big picture

`calicoctl` allows you to create, read, update, and delete $[prodname] objects
from the command line. These objects represent the networking and policy
of your cluster.

You should limit access to `calicoctl` and your $[prodname] datastore to
trusted administrators. We discuss methods of limiting access to the
$[prodname] datastore in the [configuration section](configure/index.mdx).

You can run `calicoctl` on any host with network access to the
$[prodname] datastore as either a binary or a container.
As a binary on a single host, you can also run it as a kubectl plugin.

<!--- Change download URL to latest release if user browsing master branch.  --->

export const version = '$[version]' === 'master' ? 'master' : '$[releaseTitle]';

## How to

:::note

Make sure you always install the version of `calicoctl` that matches the version of $[prodname] running on your cluster.

### Install calicoctl as a binary on a single host

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux" value="Linux-0">

Log into the host, open a terminal prompt, and navigate to the location where you want to install the binary.

:::note

Consider navigating to a location that's in your `PATH`. For example, `/usr/local/bin/`.

:::

Use the following command to download the `calicoctl` binary.

```bash
curl -o calicoctl -L $[downloadsurl]/ee/binaries/$[releaseTitle]/calicoctl
```

```bash
curl -o calicoctl -L $[downloadsurl]/ee/binaries/$[releaseTitle]/calicoctl
```

Set the file to be executable.

```bash
chmod +x calicoctl
```

:::note

If the location of `calicoctl` is not already in your `PATH`, move the file to one that is or add its location to your `PATH`. This will allow you to invoke it without having to prepend its location.

Use the following command to download the `calicoctl` binary.

```bash
curl -o calicoctl -L $[downloadsurl]/ee/binaries/$[releaseTitle]/calicoctl-darwin-amd64
```

Set the file to be executable.

```bash
chmod +x calicoctl
```

:::note

If you get the error, `cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified` when using `calicoctl` for the first time, go to `Applications > System Preferences > Security & Privacy` in the `General` tab at the bottom of the window click `Allow anyway`.

Log into the host, open a terminal prompt, and navigate to the location where you want to install the binary.

:::note

Consider navigating to a location that's in your `PATH`. For example, `/usr/local/bin/`.

:::

Use the following command to download the `calicoctl` binary.

```bash
curl -o kubectl-calico -L $[downloadsurl]/ee/binaries/$[releaseTitle]/calicoctl
```

Set the file to be executable.

```bash
chmod +x kubectl-calico
```

:::note

If the location of `kubectl-calico` is not already in your `PATH`, move the file to one that is or add its location to your `PATH`. This is required for kubectl to detect the plugin and allow you to use it.

:::note

If you get the error, "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" when using `calicoctl` for the first time, go to Applications > System Preferences > Security & Privacy in the **General** tab at the bottom of the window click `Allow anyway`.

:::

```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "$[downloadsurl]/ee/binaries/$[releaseTitle]/calicoctl-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "kubectl-calico.exe"
```

Verify the plugin works.

```bash
kubectl calico -h
```

You can now run any `calicoctl` subcommands through `kubectl calico`.

:::note

If you run these commands from your local machine (instead of a host node), some of the node related subcommands will not work (like node status).

### Install calicoctl as a container on a single host

1. Ensure that you have the [`config.json` file with the private Tigera registry credentials](../../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/calico-enterprise.mdx#get-private-registry-credentials-and-license-key).

1. From a terminal prompt, use the following command to either create or open the `~/.docker/config.json` file.

   ```bash
   vi ~/.docker/config.json
   ```

1. Depending on the existing contents of the file, edit it in one of the following ways.

   - **New file**: Paste in the entire contents of the `config.json` file from Tigera.

   - **Existing file without quay.io object**: Add the following lines from the `config.json` inside the `"auth"` object.

     ```json
     "quay.io": {
       "auth": "<ROBOT-TOKEN-VALUE>",
       "email": ""
     }
     ```

   - **Existing file with quay.io object**: Add the following lines from the `config.json` inside the `"quay.io"` object.

     ```json
     "auth": "<ROBOT-TOKEN-VALUE>",
     "email": ""
     ```

1. Save and close the file.

1. Use the following commands to pull the `calicoctl` image from the Tigera
   registry.

   ```bash
   docker pull $[registry]$[componentImage.calicoctl]
   ```

1. Confirm that the image has loaded by typing `docker images`.

   ```bash
   REPOSITORY                TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
   $[releases.0.components.calicoctl.image]    $[releases.0.components.calicoctl.version]            e07d59b0eb8a   2 minutes ago   42MB
   ```
