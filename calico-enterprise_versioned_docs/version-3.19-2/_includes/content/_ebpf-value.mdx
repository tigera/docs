The eBPF data plane mode has several advantages over standard Linux networking pipeline mode:

- It scales to higher throughput.
- It uses less CPU per GBit.
- It has native support for Kubernetes services (without needing kube-proxy) that:

  - Reduces first packet latency for packets to services.
  - Preserves external client source IP addresses all the way to the pod.
  - Supports DSR (Direct Server Return) for more efficient service routing.
  - Uses less CPU than kube-proxy to keep the data plane in sync.
