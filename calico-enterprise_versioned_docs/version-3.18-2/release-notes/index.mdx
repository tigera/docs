# Calico Enterprise 3.18 release notes

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of $[prodname].

## New features and enhancements

### VXLAN support for cluster mesh and federation

We've expanded our support of cluster mesh to clusters using VXLAN for networking. Cluster mesh can be used to federate services and endpoints to authorize cross-cluster communication with $[prodname] network policies.

For more information, see [Configure federated endpoint identity and services](../multicluster/federation/kubeconfig.mdx).

### Helm-based install for multi-cluster management deployments

We've added the support for Helm for installing and setting up deployments that use the multi-cluster management feature. With Helm, DevOps teams can automate these complex deployments more easily.

For more information, see [Helm for multi-cluster management](../multicluster/set-up-multi-cluster-management/standard-install/).

### HPC-based Windows install and upgrade

We've added support for operator-based install and upgrade for Windows nodes using HPC (HostProcess/Privileged containers). $[prodname] can now bootstrap Windows worker nodes just like Linux worker nodes. Platform engineers can scale Windows worker nodes with an auto-scaling node pool without bootstrapping each node manually, and upgrade $[prodname] deployments without manually upgrading nodes one at a time.

For more information, see [the $[prodnameWindows] Operator guide](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/windows-calico/operator).

### Support for Azure CNI with overlay networking for AKS

We now officially support AKS clusters that are using overlay networking. This option is useful if you've exhausted your IP addresses. This option augments existing support for Azure CNI with no overlay (where a VNET IP address is assigned to every pod).

To review Azure CNI options, see [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/aks).

### Support for Kubernetes 1.28

We now support Kubernetes v1.28 for most platforms.

To review platform support, see [Support and compatibility](../getting-started/compatibility).

### Performance improvements for Service Graph

We've added backend improvements to Service Graph that increases the performance when rendering a large number of graph nodes.

### Improved Felix performance for extremely large clusters

We've improved how Felix processes active policy rules for clusters with extremely high numbers of endpoints and policy rules.
Previously, calculating selector-based rules in these circumstances could take a long time or end in failure.
Now Felix can perform these calculations quickly while reducing CPU usage by orders of magnitude.

For more information, see [Selector performance in EntityRules](../reference/resources/globalnetworkpolicy.mdx#selector-performance-in-entityrules).

### Improved scalability for large number of policies when using the eBPF data plane

We've made several improvements that allow you to enforce a larger number of $[prodname] network policies when using the eBPF data plane.

### New performance optimizations for egress gateways

$[prodname] includes new performance options for egress gateway policies that can be used to ensure that application client and gateway pods are on the same cluster node.

For more information, see [Optimize egress networking for workloads with long-lived TCP connections](../networking/egress/egress-gateway-maintenance).

### Configurable XFF headers for Envoy

We've added support for XFF to propagate the original IP address when proxying application layer traffic with Envoy within a Kubernetes cluster.

For more information, see [Installation reference](../reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.EnvoySettings).

### Alert-only mode for Workload-based Web Application Firewall (WAF)

We've added a new default mode for WAF that is monitor/event only.
This allows operators and security teams to verify the accuracy of configured rules before actively blocking traffic.

For more information, see [Web application firewall](../threat/web-application-firewall).

### Additional options for Helm-based installs

We've added new options for Helm installs including: set the number of replicas for specific deployments, node affinity rules, and configure Wireguard.

For more information, see [Helm installation reference](../reference/installation/helm_customization).

## Deprecated and removed features

* The anomaly detection feature is removed in this release.
  If anomaly detection is enabled and you upgrade to $[prodname] 3.18, you will stop receiving anomaly detection alerts.
* The [manual installation method for Windows](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/windows-calico/manual-install/) is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  The recommended installation method is now [operator-based](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/windows-calico/operator).
* The [FIPS mode](../operations/fips.mdx) feature is deprecated in this release.
  It will be removed in Calico Enterprise 3.19.
* The [AWS security groups integration](../network-policy/policy-firewalls/aws-integration/index.mdx) is deprecated in this release.
  It will be removed in Calico Enterprise 3.19.
* The ingress log collection feature is deprecated in this release.
  It will be removed in Calico Enterprise 3.19.

## Technology Preview features

- [Web application firewall](../threat/web-application-firewall)

   Protect cloud-native applications from application layer attacks.

- [Security events management](../threat/security-event-management)

   Get alerts on security events that may indicate a threat is present in your Kubernetes cluster.

- [DNS policy for Windows](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/windows-calico/limitations#dns-policy-limitations)

   Use domain names in policies to identify services outside the cluster, which is often operationally simpler and more robust than using IP addresses.

## Known issues

* Flow logs for the Windows workloads currently do not display entries with a Deny action.
* Before upgrading a $[prodname] cluster on MKE v3.6 to the latest $[prodname] version: 1) upgrade MKE from 3.6 to 3.7, then 2) upgrade $[prodname].
* L7 logs with source name `pvt` is not visible in Service Graph.
* *Multi-cluster management users only*. If the `manager-tls` and `internal-manager-tls` secrets have overlapping DNS names, components such as `es-calico-kube-controllers` will log certificate errors. If you have previously installed a version older than v3.13.0 and never changed your manager-tls secret from the tigera-operator namespace, you must delete both of these secrets. This applies to you if the following command prints a certificate: `$ kubectl get secret manager-tls -n tigera-operator -o "jsonpath={.data['cert']}"`.
* Upgrading to $[prodname] 3.18.0 on Rancher/RKE from $[prodname] 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed.
* Calico panics if kube-proxy or other components are using native `nftables` rules instead of the `iptables-nft` compatibility shim. Until Calico supports native nftables mode, we recommend that you continue to use the iptables-nft compatibility layer for all components. (The compatibility layer was the only option before Kubernetes v1.29 added alpha-level `nftables` support.) Do not run Calico in "legacy" iptables mode on a system that is also using `nftables`. Although this combination does not panic or fail (at least on kernels that support both), the interaction between `iptables` "legacy" mode and `nftables` is confusing: both `iptables` and `nftables` rules can be executed on the same packet, leading to policy verdicts being "overturned".
<li>
  Some application layer features are not working as expected for $[prodname] installations with the following deployment types:
  <ul>
  <li>AKS clusters with Azure CNI for networking and $[prodname] for network policy</li>
    <li>RKE2 clusters installed with Rancher UI</li>
  </ul>
  During installation, for these deployment types, <code>kubeletVolumePluginPath</code> is set to <code>None</code> in the Installation CR, causing all application layer features to stop working.
  The affected features include web application firewalls, application layer policies, and L7 logging.
  As a workaround, you can restore the default value by running the following command on an affected cluster:
  <CodeBlock language='bash'>{`kubectl patch installation.tigera.io default --type=merge  -p '{"spec":{"kubeletVolumePluginPath":"/var/lib/kubelet"}}'`}</CodeBlock>
</li>
