# Install calicoq

## About installing calicoq

You can run `calicoq` on any host with network access to the
{variables.prodname} datastore as either a binary or a container.

:::note

Ensure that you install the binary on a Linux machine. The binary does not work on other machines.

:::

For step-by-step instructions, refer to the section that
corresponds to your desired deployment.

- [As a binary on a single host](#install-calicoq-as-a-binary-on-a-single-host)
- [As a container on a single host](#install-calicoq-as-a-container-on-a-single-host)

<!--- Change download URL to latest release if user browsing master branch.  --->

## Install calicoq as a binary on a single host

1. Log into the host, open a terminal prompt, and navigate to the location where
   you want to install the binary.

   :::tip

   Consider navigating to a location that's in your `PATH`. For example,
   `/usr/local/bin/`.

   :::

1. Use the following command to download the `calicoq` binary.

   <MaintenanceClisCalicoqInstallingTemp />

1. Set the file to be executable.

   ```
   chmod +x calicoq
   ```

   :::note

   If the location of `calicoq` is not already in your `PATH`, move the file
   to one that is or add its location to your `PATH`. This will allow you to invoke it
   without having to prepend its location.

   :::

**Next step**:

[Configure `calicoq` to connect to your datastore](configure/index.mdx).

## Install calicoq as a container on a single host

1. Ensure that you have the [`config.json` file with the private Tigera registry credentials](../../../getting-started/install-on-clusters/calico-enterprise.mdx#get-private-registry-credentials-and-license-key).

1. From a terminal prompt, use the following command to either create or open the `~/.docker/config.json` file.

   ```bash
   vi ~/.docker/config.json
   ```

1. Depending on the existing contents of the file, edit it in one of the following ways.

   - **New file**: Paste in the entire contents of the `config.json` file from Tigera.

   - **Existing file without quay.io object**: Add the following lines from the `config.json` inside the `"auth"` object.

     ```json
     "quay.io": {
       "auth": "<ROBOT-TOKEN-VALUE>",
       "email": ""
     }
     ```

   - **Existing file with quay.io object**: Add the following lines from the `config.json` inside the `"quay.io"` object.

     ```json
     "auth": "<ROBOT-TOKEN-VALUE>",
     "email": ""
     ```

1. Save and close the file.

1. Use the following commands to pull the `calicoq` image from the Tigera
   registry.

   <CodeBlock language='bash'>
   docker pull {variables.registry}{% component_image("calicoq") %}
   </CodeBlock>

1. Confirm that the image has loaded by typing `docker images`.

   ```bash
   REPOSITORY                TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
   {variables.releases.0.components.calicoq.image}    {{ releases.0.components.calicoq.version }}            e07d59b0eb8a   2 minutes ago   42MB
   ```

**Next step**:

[Configure `calicoq` to connect to your datastore](configure/index.mdx).
