# Configure storage for logs and reports

## Big picture

Before installing $[prodname], you must configure persistent storage for flow logs, DNS logs, audit logs, and compliance reports.

## Concepts

Before configuring a storage class for $[prodname], the following terms will help you understand storage interactions.

<PersistentStorageTerms />

## Before you begin...

**Review log storage recommendations**

Review [Log storage recommendations](log-storage-recommendations.mdx) for guidance on the number of nodes and resources to configure for your environment.

**Determine storage support**

Determine the storage types that are available on your cluster. If you are using dynamic provisioning, verify it is supported.
If you are using local disks, you may find the [sig-storage local static provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner) useful. It creates and manages PersistentVolumes by watching for disks mounted in a configured directory.

:::caution

Do not use the host path storage provisioner. This provisioner is not suitable for production and results in scalability issues, instability, and data loss.

:::

:::caution

Do not use shared network file systems, such as AWS' EFS or Azure's azure-file. These file systems may result in decreases of performance and data loss.

## How to

### Create a storage class

Before installing $[prodname], create a storage class named, `tigera-elasticsearch`.

**Examples**

#### Pre-provisioned local disks

In the following example, we create a **StorageClass** to use when explicitly adding **PersistentVolumes** for local disks. This can be performed manually, or using the [sig-storage local static provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner).

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: tigera-elasticsearch
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
reclaimPolicy: Retain
```

:::note

If local persistent volumes are provisioned on an SELinux-enabled host, you can use the `/mnt/tigera` host path created by the $[prodname] policy package.

:::

#### AWS EBS disks

In the following example for an AWS cloud provider integration, the **StorageClass** is based on [how your EBS disks are provisioned](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html):

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Amazon EBS CSI" value="Amazon EBS CSI-0">

Make sure the CSI plugin is enabled in your cluster and apply the following manifest.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: tigera-elasticsearch
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
reclaimPolicy: Retain
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Legacy Kubernetes EBS driver" value="Legacy Kubernetes EBS driver-1">

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: tigera-elasticsearch
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp2
  fsType: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Retain
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### AKS Azure Files storage

In the following example for an AKS cloud provider integration, the **StorageClass** tells $[prodname] to use LRS disks for log storage.
:::note

Premium Storage is recommended for databases greater than 100GiB and for production installations.

:::

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: tigera-elasticsearch
provisioner: disk.cni.azure.com
parameters:
  cachingmode: ReadOnly
  kind: Managed
  storageaccounttype: StandardSSD_LRS
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

#### GCP Persistent Disks

In the following example for a GKE cloud provider integration, the **StorageClass** tells $[prodname] to use the GCE Persistent Disks for log storage.

:::note

There are currently two types available `pd-standard` and `pd-ssd`. For production deployments, we recommend using the `pd-ssd` storage type.

:::

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: tigera-elasticsearch
provisioner: pd.csi.storage.gke.io
parameters:
  type: pd-ssd
  replication-type: none
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```
