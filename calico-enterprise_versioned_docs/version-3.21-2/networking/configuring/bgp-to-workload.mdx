# Configure BGP peering with nested clusters running on KubeVirt VMs

## Big picture

Configure BGP peering with $[prodname] nodes running on KubeVirt VMs that are
running on your Kubernetes cluster.

## Value

Run nested Kubernetes clusters in VMs on your parent Kubernetes cluster.
Avoid network overlay overheads; extend layer 3 network reachability all the
way from pods running in the nested cluster to your physical network
infrastructure.

## Concepts

This guide assumes you have a good understanding of BGP and $[prodname]'s BGP
peering options.

The guide makes use of several $[prodname] resources, including:

- [BGPPeer](../../reference/resources/bgppeer.mdx) - Used to configure peerings
  both with external BGP routers and with BGP-enabled workloads.
- [BGPFilter](../../reference/resources/bgpfilter.mdx) - Defines a BGP filter
  to control which routes are imported or exported between BGP peers.
- [BGPConfiguration](../../reference/resources/bgpconfig.mdx) - Configures global
  BGP settings for the cluster.

See [Configure BGP peering](./bgp.mdx) for a general overview of these concepts.

## Supported BGP topologies

![](/img/calico/nested-bgp.svg)

Both parent and nested clusters must be configured to use non-overlay BGP
networking.

eBGP must be used for peering between parent cluster and nested workload cluster.
This means that the AS numbers of the parent cluster and the nested cluster must be different.

iBGP peerings to workloads are not supported:
- iBGP to the nested cluster has not been tested. It may work with appropriate
  `BGPFilter` resources to ensure the correct routes are re-advertised.

Peering with workloads and using a BGP mesh within the cluster is not supported;
this combination has not been tested and it is likely to require additional
`BGPFilter` resources to ensure routes are correctly re-advertised.

## Supported KubeVirt networking modes

Only KubeVirt's "bridged" networking mode is supported. This is because the
peering from parent cluster to the workload is done using the "pod IP" of the
workload.  This must agree with the IP that the workload itself uses to
source traffic.

## How to

- [Configure global BGP settings](#configure-global-bgp-settings)
- [Create BGPFilter resources](#configure-bgpfilter-resources)
- [Configure parent cluster BGP topology](#configure-parent-cluster-bgp-topology)
- [Configure BGP peering with workloads](#configure-bgp-peering-with-workloads)
- [Configure more than one nested cluster](#configure-more-than-one-nested-cluster)

### Configure global BGP settings

In order to ease configuration of the `BGPPeer` resources in the nested clusters,
the workload BGP peering feature uses a single virtual IP (per IP version) that
is provisioned on every node in the parent cluster. The workloads are configured
to peer with this virtual IP rather than needing to know the specific IP of their
parent node.

To avoid conflicts with your network, the addresses are configurable through
the `BGPConfiguration` resource, and there are no defaults. They must be
configured to enable the feature:

For IPv4, we recommend using a link-local IP address that is not otherwise
in use on the parent cluster's network. Note that $[prodname] uses
169.254.0.1 and 169.254.0.2 internally so these must not be used. You may also
wish to avoid cloud provider metadata addresses, such as 169.254.169.254
(as used by AWS). In this guide we'll use 169.254.0.179; you can use the same
address unless it conflicts with some other use on your nodes.

If using the IPv6 address, you _must not_ use a link local address (because
IPv6 requires link-local addresses to be qualified with a scope tag, and $[prodname]
currently has no way to provision the correct scopes). Instead, we recommend
using a ULA address that is not otherwise in use in your network. In this
guide we'll use fdc9:9723:09bc::1 (which was chosen randomly according to
RFC 4193 for this guide, so it may be suitable for your use as well).

Once you have chosen the IP address(es), configure the `BGPConfiguration` resource.
(You can omit the IPv6 address if not using IPv6.)

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: BGPConfiguration
metadata:
 name: default
spec:
  ...
  localWorkloadPeeringIPV4: "169.254.0.179"
  localWorkloadPeeringIPV6: "fdc9:9723:09bc::1"
```

### Create `BGPFilter` resources

Before creating the `BGPPeer` resource to peer with the workloads, we create
`BGPFilter` resources to control which routes are imported and exported.

- Because the workloads are running on the $[prodname] cluster, we can assume that
  they already have a valid default route via their host node. Hence, we don't
  need to export any routes to the workloads. Create the following `BGPFilter` resource,
  which can be used to block export of any routes.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
  kind: BGPFilter
  metadata:
    name: no-export
  spec:
    exportV4:
      - action: Reject
    exportV6:
      - action: Reject
  ```

- For added security, it is also wise to limit what routes we'll accept from
  the workloads. Create a `BGPFilter` resource that only accepts routes that are within
  the IP pool of the nested cluster. For example, if the nested cluster's IP pools
  are 10.123.0.0/16 and ca11:c0::/48:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
  kind: BGPFilter
  metadata:
    name: accept-nested-ip-pools
  spec:
    importV4:
      - action: Accept
        matchOperator: In
        cidr: 10.123.0.0/16  # IP pool CIDR of nested cluster
    importV6:
      - action: Accept
        matchOperator: In
        cidr: ca11:c0::/48  # IP pool CIDR of nested cluster
  ```

In addition we need to create a `BGPFilter` to tell $[prodname] to re-advertise
routes learned from the workloads to the ToR. Create the following `BGPFilter` resource,
adjusting the CIDRs as appropriate for your nested cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: BGPFilter
metadata:
  name: export-to-tor
spec:
  exportV4:
  - action: Accept
    matchOperator: In
    cidr: 10.123.0.0/16
    source: RemotePeers
  exportV6:
  - action: Accept
    matchOperator: In
    cidr: ca11:c0::/48
    source: RemotePeers
```

### Configure parent cluster BGP topology

Configure the parent cluster to use BGP networking and to peer with its
top-of-rack router(s) over eBGP. For example, by using the
[downward default model](../../reference/architecture/design/l3-interconnect-fabric.mdx#the-downward-default-model).

Include the `BGPFilter` resource defined above in the `BGPPeer` resource used to peer with the ToR:

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: node-tor-peer
spec:
  peerIP: <ToR IP>
  asNumber: <ToR AS number>
  filters:
  - export-to-tor
```

:::note

If the parent cluster peers with the top-of-rack router(s) over iBGP, add `nextHopMode: Self` to the `node-tor-peer` resource.
This ensures that nodes in the parent cluster rewrite the next hop of routes learned from workloads to their own local IP address.

:::

### Configure BGP peering with workloads

In the parent cluster, create a `BGPPeer` resource to peer with the workloads.

- The `localWorkloadSelector` field is used to select which workloads to peer with.
  In this example, we select workloads with the label `color=red`.

- Include the `BGPFilter` resources defined above in the `BGPPeer` resource to control
  which routes are imported and exported.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
 name: peer-to-workloads
spec:
 localWorkloadSelector: color == 'red'
 asNumber: <workload cluster's AS number>
 filters:
 - no-export
 - accept-nested-ip-pools
```

Both per-node and global `BGPPeer` resources are supported. To limit the peering to certain nodes, use the `nodeSelector` field.

:::note

`localWorkloadSelector` is scoped to all workloads and it does not currently have a corresponding
"namespace selector". To match on namespace labels, you can prefix the label name with `pcns.`.

:::

In the child cluster,

- Ensure that the node-to-node mesh is disabled in the `BGPConfiguration` resource and
  that the workload cluster's AS number is set:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
  kind: BGPConfiguration
  metadata:
   name: default
  spec:
   nodeToNodeMeshEnabled: false
   asNumber: <workload cluster's AS number>
  ```

- Create a `BGPPeer` resource (per desired IP version) that peers with the
  parent clusters' virtual IP:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
  kind: BGPPeer
  metadata:
   name: peer-to-parent-cluster
  spec:
   peerIP: 169.254.0.179
   asNumber: <parent cluster's AS number>
  ---
  apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
  kind: BGPPeer
  metadata:
   name: peer-to-parent-cluster-v6
  spec:
   peerIP: "fdc9:9723:09bc::1"
   asNumber: <parent cluster's AS number>
  ```

### Configure more than one nested cluster

You can configure more than one nested cluster by:

- Choosing a unique non-overlapping IP pool for each nested cluster.
- In the parent cluster: creating a new import `BGPFilter` resource for each cluster to import its routes.
- In the parent cluster: creating a new, uniquely-named `BGPPeer` resource for each cluster to peer with the
  parent cluster. You can re-use the shared "no-export" `BGPFilter` resource with every nested cluster peering.
- In the parent cluster: updating the `export-to-tor` `BGPFilter` resource to include the new cluster's CIDRs.
- In the nested cluster: adding a copy of the `peer-to-parent-cluster` `BGPPeer`(s). These should
  be the same in all nested clusters since a parent cluster always uses the same virtual IP for all
  nested clusters.

:::note

If you plan to use many nested clusters consider allocating their IP pools from a single larger
CIDR. Then the `export-to-tor` filter can be simplified to match on the larger CIDR only.

If you trust the nested clusters, similarly, you could also re-use a single `accept-nested-ip-pools` filter
for all child clusters.
