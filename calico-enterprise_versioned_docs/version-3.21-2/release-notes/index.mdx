# Calico Enterprise 3.21 release notes

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of $[prodname].

This version of Calico Enterprise is based on [Calico Open Source $[openSourceVersion]](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/$[openSourceVersion]/release-notes).

## New features and enhancements

### Introducing Calico Ingress Gateway (tech-preview)

$[prodname] now includes the ability to deploy Calico Ingress Gateway which is an Enterprise hardened, 100% upstream distribution of Envoy Gateway.
Envoy Gateway is an implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API with several extensions that provide advanced security and traffic management features.

For more information, see [Configure an ingress gateway](../networking/gateway-api.mdx).

### IPAM for load balancers

$[prodname] now extends its IPAM capabilities to support service LoadBalancer IP allocation, providing a centralized, automated approach to managing LoadBalancer IPs within Kubernetes clusters.

For more information, see [LoadBalancer IP address management](../networking/ipam/service-loadbalancer.mdx)

### Support for WireGuard encryption between clusters

We added support for WireGuard encryption between federated services and endpoints in different clusters.

For more information, see [Creating the cluster mesh](../multicluster/federation/kubeconfig.mdx).


### Improvements to flow log reporting for staged network policies

This release introduces changes to improve how staged network policies are reported in flow logs.
Previously, a flow log reported the action of staged network policy rules at the time a connection was initiated.
For long-lived connections, changing a staged policy did not affect the reported action.
Now, flow logs report the action that represents the current policy rules.
Flow logs report an action that reflects how a new connection would interact with the current staged policies.

As part of this, we've also added more granular information about policies in the flow logs.
For more information, see [Flow log data types](../observability/elastic/flow/datatypes.mdx
).

### Security event webhooks for Alertmanager

We added support for using webhooks to post security alerts directly to Alertmanager.

For more information, see [Webhooks for security event alerts](../threat/configuring-webhooks.mdx).

### View rule details for Web Application Firewall

You can now use the web console to view details of the default rule set used by Web Application Firewall.
From the **Web Application Firewall** page, click the **Rulesets** tab to open a list of default rules.

### Enhancements

* **Control-plane label customization for AKS:**
  We added support for customizing the namespace labels on AKS clusters.
  By default we apply a `control-plane` label to namespaces so that they are exempt from Azure Policy.
  If you wish to apply Azure Policy to our namespaces, you can now override this label.
* **Log levels for api-server component:**
  You can now tune the log level for the API server to better support production deployments and troubleshooting scenarios.
* **Clusterrolebindings have reduced privileges:**
  Clusterrolebindings for the `tigera-operator`, `calico-kube-controller`, and `calico-prometheus-operator` components have been changed to improve $[prodname]'s least-privileged security model.
* Improved scaling for non-cluster hosts by having them connect to Typha, rather than the Kubernetes apiserver directly.
* Added web console support for `AdminNetworkPolicy` and `BaseAdminNetworkPolicy` tiers (view-only).

### Calico Enterprise 3.21.1 general availability release

July 16, 2025

Calico Enterprise 3.21.1 is now available as a general availability release.

This release is supported for use in production.

#### Enhancements

* Added observability for forwarding decisions made by hosts. Apply on forward or pre-DNAT policy decisions made by hosts
when forwarding traffic previously did not result in flow logs. For more information, see [host forwarded traffic](../network-policy/hosts/host-forwarded-traffic.mdx).
* Added support for peak rate (and optionally min burst) configuration to bandwidth QoS controls.
* Added support for packet burst configuration to packet rate QoS controls.
* Added the NextHopMode field to BGPPeer API. NextHopMode defines the method of calculating the next hop attribute for received routes. This replaces and expands the deprecated KeepOriginalNextHop field.
* Added support for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).

#### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue that prevented the Tigera Operator from detecting HTTP proxies set on the guardian container.
* Fixed security contexts for init containers when certificate management is enabled, so the certificates have the right file permissions.
* Fixed upper and lower boundaries of packet rate and number of connections QoS controls to be in-line with kernel limits.
* Skip mounting cgroup in bpffs init container when in iptables mode.
* Permissions on files in `/var/log/calico` have been lowered from `755` to `644`.
* Added delete permission to Tigera Operator for AdminNetworkPolicy and BaseAdminNetworkPolicy custom resource definitions. This is required for setting an owner reference on OpenShift.
* Fixed an issue where application layer policy would only match `TCP`, `UDP`, or `ICMP`, it now matches all protocols.
* Fixed Calico early networking to retry netlink list APIs when it returns EINTR and eventually use whatever data it received.

#### Known issues

* Flow logs generated for forwarding decisions may have their byte and packet counts erroneously reported as 0 for allowed traffic. This will be addressed in the next patch release.

To update an existing installation of Calico Enterprise 3.20, see [Install a patch release](../getting-started/manifest-archive.mdx).

### Calico Enterprise 3.21.2 bug fix release

August 8, 2025

#### Enhancements

* The BGPPeer API now allows different configuration for each side of a BGP session by using the new ReversePeering field.

#### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where IPAM allocation could leak handles when many workloads are scheduled to the same node at the same time, causing timeouts by "thundering herd".
* Fixed a race between loading kubernetes services and conntrack cleanup. If conntrack cleanup ran before services were loaded, all service entries would look stale and get cleaned up.
* Fixed an issue where Felix would panic when upgrading to v3.21.1 in eBPF mode.
* Flow logs now correctly track packet and byte counts for forwarded traffic, ensuring accurate volume metrics for complete traffic visibility and analysis.
* Removed logging in Guardian of connection resets that are expected and do not indicate an operational issue.

To update an existing installation of Calico Enterprise 3.21, see [Install a patch release](../getting-started/manifest-archive.mdx).

### Calico Enterprise 3.21.3 bug fix release

November 05, 2025

#### Enhancements

##### Service Graph Enhancements

We've improved the Service Graph for clusters which have a very high volume of flows. When a high volume of flows is detected for a time range, a new namespaced-focused experience provides quicker access to insights from the graph.
We've also added more feedback into the UI to keep you informed on the progress of graph computation.

##### Additional Enhancements

* The UI now uses the OIDC code flow when communicating with Dex, which is more secure. This affects all external identity providers (OIDC, LDAP, Openshift).
* Added support for custom-signed Calico Node certificates on non-cluster hosts.
* Add Support for IPv4 fragmentation in eBPF mode.

#### Bug fixes

* ***Breaking change***: This release fixes the defaulting behaviour for `Authentication.Spec.OIDC.requestedScopes` such that it now includes `offline_access` as documented in the API. In the unlikely case that your identity provider does not support `offline_access` and if you did previously not specify `requestedScopes`, you should set `requestedScopes` to `[profile, openid, email]`.
* Fixed an issue that prevented the UI from renewing session tokens when using LDAP.
* Fixed an issue where CSRs need manual deletion if a non-cluster host's CSR was rejected by the certificate signer.
* Fixed an issue where the operator would run into access errors if it was installed in a namespace other than `tigera-operator`.
* When IPAM runs out of address space, Calico will try to reclaim empty blocks from other nodes before giving up.
* Avoid writing 0 or negative values to prometheus from linseed, leading to recoverable panics in the logs.

#### Known issues
* There is an issue affecting our Windows images, we are currently investigating it. Please work with your customer success representative for an updated ETA.

To update an existing installation of Calico Enterprise 3.21, see [Install a patch release](../getting-started/manifest-archive.mdx).

### Calico Enterprise 3.21.4 hotfix release

November 27, 2025

#### Bug fixes

* eBPF dataplane: fix loading programs in 6.12 kernels
* Add FelixConfiguration parameter EgressIPHostIfacePattern which controls the src_valid_mark sysctl on egress interfaces when needed
* Only assign service IPs for services with LoadBalancerClass calico when the load balancer controller is in RequestedServicesOnly mode

Please note that this hotfix release has not received the normal level of CVE updates in order to accelerate the blocking eBPF fix noted above.  Normal CVE resolution will be included in the next full patch release.

To update an existing installation of Calico Enterprise 3.21, see [Install a patch release](../getting-started/manifest-archive.mdx).

### Calico Enterprise 3.21.5 hotfix release

December 16, 2025

#### Bug fixes

* eBPF - Fixed dropping of fragmented packets with a single uplink host interface.

Please note that this hotfix release has not received the normal level of CVE updates in order to accelerate the blocking eBPF fix noted above.  Normal CVE resolution will be included in the next full patch release.
