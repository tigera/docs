# Calico Enterprise 3.21 release notes

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of $[prodname].

This version of Calico Enterprise is based on [Calico Open Source $[openSourceVersion]](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/$[openSourceVersion]/release-notes).

## New features and enhancements

### Introducing Calico Ingress Gateway (tech-preview)

$[prodname] now includes the ability to deploy Calico Ingress Gateway which is an Enterprise hardened, 100% upstream distribution of Envoy Gateway.
Envoy Gateway is an implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API with several extensions that provide advanced security and traffic management features.

For more information, see [Configure an ingress gateway](../networking/gateway-api.mdx).

### IPAM for load balancers

$[prodname] now extends its IPAM capabilities to support service LoadBalancer IP allocation, providing a centralized, automated approach to managing LoadBalancer IPs within Kubernetes clusters.

For more information, see [LoadBalancer IP address management](../networking/ipam/service-loadbalancer.mdx)

### Support for WireGuard encryption between clusters

We added support for WireGuard encryption between federated services and endpoints in different clusters.

For more information, see [Creating the cluster mesh](../multicluster/federation/kubeconfig.mdx).


### Improvements to flow log reporting for staged network policies

This release introduces changes to improve how staged network policies are reported in flow logs.
Previously, a flow log reported the action of staged network policy rules at the time a connection was initiated.
For long-lived connections, changing a staged policy did not affect the reported action.
Now, flow logs report the action that represents the current policy rules.
Flow logs report an action that reflects how a new connection would interact with the current staged policies.

As part of this, we've also added more granular information about policies in the flow logs.
For more information, see [Flow log data types](../observability/elastic/flow/datatypes.mdx
).

### Security event webhooks for Alertmanager

We added support for using webhooks to post security alerts directly to Alertmanager.

For more information, see [Webhooks for security event alerts](../threat/configuring-webhooks.mdx).

### View rule details for Web Application Firewall

You can now use the web console to view details of the default rule set used by Web Application Firewall.
From the **Web Application Firewall** page, click the **Rulesets** tab to open a list of default rules.

### Enhancements

* **Control-plane label customization for AKS:**
  We added support for customizing the namespace labels on AKS clusters.
  By default we apply a `control-plane` label to namespaces so that they are exempt from Azure Policy.
  If you wish to apply Azure Policy to our namespaces, you can now override this label.
* **Log levels for api-server component:**
  You can now tune the log level for the API server to better support production deployments and troubleshooting scenarios.
* **Clusterrolebindings have reduced privileges:**
  Clusterrolebindings for the `tigera-operator`, `calico-kube-controller`, and `calico-prometheus-operator` components have been changed to improve $[prodname]'s least-privileged security model.
* Improved scaling for non-cluster hosts by having them connect to Typha, rather than the Kubernetes apiserver directly.
* Added web console support for `AdminNetworkPolicy` and `BaseAdminNetworkPolicy` tiers (view-only).

### Calico Enterprise 3.21.1 general availability release

July 16, 2025

Calico Enterprise 3.21.1 is now available as a general availability release.

This release is supported for use in production.

#### Enhancements

* Added observability for forwarding decisions made by hosts. Apply on forward or pre-DNAT policy decisions made by hosts
when forwarding traffic previously did not result in flow logs. For more information, see [host forwarded traffic](../network-policy/hosts/host-forwarded-traffic.mdx).
* Added support for peak rate (and optionally min burst) configuration to bandwidth QoS controls.
* Added support for packet burst configuration to packet rate QoS controls.
* Added the NextHopMode field to BGPPeer API. NextHopMode defines the method of calculating the next hop attribute for received routes. This replaces and expands the deprecated KeepOriginalNextHop field.
* Added support for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).

#### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue that prevented the Tigera Operator from detecting HTTP proxies set on the guardian container.
* Fixed security contexts for init containers when certificate management is enabled, so the certificates have the right file permissions.
* Fixed upper and lower boundaries of packet rate and number of connections QoS controls to be in-line with kernel limits.
* Skip mounting cgroup in bpffs init container when in iptables mode.
* Permissions on files in `/var/log/calico` have been lowered from `755` to `644`.
* Added delete permission to Tigera Operator for AdminNetworkPolicy and BaseAdminNetworkPolicy custom resource definitions. This is required for setting an owner reference on OpenShift.
* Fixed an issue where application layer policy would only match `TCP`, `UDP`, or `ICMP`, it now matches all protocols.
* Fixed Calico early networking to retry netlink list APIs when it returns EINTR and eventually use whatever data it received.

#### Known issues

* Flow logs generated for forwarding decisions may have their byte and packet counts erroneously reported as 0 for allowed traffic. This will be addressed in the next patch release.
