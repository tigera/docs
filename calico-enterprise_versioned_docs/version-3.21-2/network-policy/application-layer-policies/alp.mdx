# Enable and enforce application layer policies

Application layer policies let you configure access controls based on L7 attributes. 

## Before you begin

### Limitations

* Application layer policy is not compatible with a service mesh such as Istio.
* Application layer policy can restrict only _ingress_ traffic.
  It can not restrict egress traffic.
* Support for L7 attributes is limited to HTTP method and URL exact/prefix path.
* Supported protocols are limited to TCP-based protocols (for example, HTTP, HTTPS, or gRPC).
* Application layer policies apply to the entire cluster.
  They can not be namespaced.
* Application layer policy is supported only on Kubernetes 1.29 and later.

:::important

When you enable application layer policy for a deployment, all of that deployment's pods will restart
Active connections may be disrupted.

### Enable application layer policy (ALP)

Create an (or edit an existing ApplicationLayer) resource with the `sidecarInjection` field to `Enabled`:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: ApplicationLayer
metadata:
  name: tigera-secure
spec:
  sidecarInjection: Enabled
EOF
```

Wait for the Tigera APIServer deployment and Log collection daemonset to progress to ready.

```bash
kubectl rollout status -n tigera-system deployment/tigera-apiserver --timeout=120s
kubectl rollout status -n calico-system ds/l7-log-collector --timeout=120s
```

Patch your deployments by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl patch deployment <deployment-name> -n <deployment-namespace> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{"applicationlayer.projectcalico.org/sidecar":"true"},"annotations":{"applicationlayer.projectcalico.org/policy":"Enabled"}}}}}'
```

### Enforce application layer policies for ingress traffic

You can restrict ingress traffic using HTTP match criteria using Global network policy. 
For a list of all HTTP match parameters, see [Global network policy](/reference/resources/globalnetworkpolicy.mdx).

In the following example, the trading app is allowed ingress traffic only for HTTP GET requests that match the exact path /projects/calico, or that begins with the prefix, /users.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: customer
spec:
  selector: app == 'tradingapp'
  ingress:
   - action: Allow
     http:
       methods: ["GET"]
       paths:
         - exact: "/projects/calico"
         - prefix: "/users"
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

### Disable application layer policies

To disable the policies, do one of the following steps:
* Recreate your application pods without the sidecar label and annotations.
* Remove the `applicationLayerPolicy` field entirely.
* Remove the `sidecarInjection` field entirely, if sidecar mode was being used only for ALP.
* Delete the ApplicationLayer` custom resource if only ALP was enabled on it.
