# Creating the cluster mesh
In this page, we will create a $[prodname] cluster mesh by connecting clusters together. Once created, $[prodname] cluster mesh enables multi-cluster networking, network policy for cross-cluster connections, cross-cluster services, and encryption via WireGuard.

## Requirements
$[prodname] multi-cluster networking provides routing between clusters that preserves pod IPs. This section outlines the requirements for this routing to be established. If your network already provides routing between clusters that preserves pod IPs, you can skip this section.

### Prerequisites for $[prodname] multi-cluster networking:
- All nodes participating in the cluster mesh must be able to establish connections to each other via their private IP.
- All nodes participating in the cluster mesh must have unique node names.
- Pod CIDRs between clusters must not overlap.
- All clusters must have at least one overlay network in common (VXLAN and/or WireGuard).
- All clusters must have the same `routeSource` setting on `FelixConfiguration`.

If using VXLAN:
- The `vxlan*` settings on `FelixConfiguration` must be the same across clusters participating in the mesh.
- The underlying network must allow traffic on `vxlanPort` between clusters participating in the mesh.
- All clusters must use Calico CNI.

If using WireGuard:
- The `wireguard*` settings on `FelixConfiguration` must be the same across clusters participating in the mesh.
- The underlying network must allow traffic on `wireguardListeningPort` between clusters participating in the mesh.
- All clusters must use Calico CNI OR All clusters must use non-Calico CNI (mixing non-Calico CNI types is supported).

Note: much like intra-cluster routing in $[prodname], cross-cluster routing can utilize both VXLAN and WireGuard at the same time. If both are enabled and a WireGuard peer is not ready, communication with that peer will fall back to VXLAN.

## Setup

### Generate credentials for cross-cluster resource synchronization
:::tip[mental model]
The basis of cluster mesh is the ability for a cluster connect to a remote cluster and sync data from it. This enables each $[prodname] cluster to have a view into the datastore that includes both local and remote cluster pods.
:::

In this section, we will create a `kubeconfig` for each cluster. This `kubeconfig` is what other clusters will use to connect to a given cluster and synchronize data from it.

**For each** cluster in the cluster mesh, utilizing an existing `kubeconfig` with administrative privileges, follow these steps:

1. Create the ServiceAccount used by remote clusters for authentication:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://downloads.tigera.io/ee/v3.21.0-2.0/manifests/federation-remote-sa.yaml
   ```

1. Create the ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding used by remote clusters for authorization:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://downloads.tigera.io/ee/v3.21.0-2.0/manifests/federation-rem-rbac-kdd.yaml
   ```
1. Create the ServiceAccount token that will be used in the `kubeconfig`:

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
   metadata:
     name: tigera-federation-remote-cluster
     namespace: calico-system
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/service-account.name: "tigera-federation-remote-cluster"
   EOF
   ```

1. Use the following command to create your `kubeconfig` at `$KUBECONFIG_NAME`:
   ```yaml
   echo "apiVersion: v1
   kind: Config
   users:
     - name: tigera-federation-remote-cluster
       user:
         token: $(kubectl get secret tigera-federation-remote-cluster -n calico-system -o=jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
   clusters:
     - name: tigera-federation-remote-cluster
       cluster:
         certificate-authority-data: $(kubectl config view --raw -o=jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.certificate-authority-data}')
         server: $(kubectl config view --raw -o=jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.server}')
   contexts:
     - name: tigera-federation-remote-cluster-ctx
       context:
         cluster: tigera-federation-remote-cluster
         user: tigera-federation-remote-cluster
   current-context: tigera-federation-remote-cluster-ctx" > $KUBECONFIG_NAME
   ```

1. Verify that the `kubeconfig` file works:

   Issue the following command to validate the `kubeconfig` file can be used to connect to the current cluster and access resources:
   ```bash
   kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG_NAME get nodes
   ```

Once you've created a `kubeconfig` for **each** cluster, you can proceed to the next section to establish the cluster connections that form the mesh.

### Establish cross-cluster resource synchronization
:::tip[mental model]
The cluster mesh is formed when each cluster connects to every other cluster to synchronize data. A cluster connects to another cluster using a RemoteClusterConfiguration, which references a kubeconfig created for the remote cluster.
:::

In this section, within each cluster, we will create a RemoteClusterConfiguration for each other cluster in the mesh. This RemoteClusterConfiguration instructs the cluster to connect to a cluster using a kubeconfig.

With each cluster being connected to each other cluster, a full cluster mesh will be formed.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="$[prodname] multi-cluster Routing" label="$[prodname] multi-cluster routing">
:::tip[mental model]
$[prodname] achieves cross-cluster routing by extending the overlay network of a cluster to include nodes from remote clusters. This is made possible by each cluster having a view into the datastore that now includes remote pods and nodes.
:::
**For each pair** of clusters in the cluster mesh (e.g. \{A,B\}, \{A,C\}, \{B,C\} for clusters A,B,C):

1. In cluster 1, create a secret that contains the `kubeconfig` for cluster 2:

   Determine the namespace (`<secret-namespace>`) for the secret to replace in all steps.
   The simplest method to create a secret for a remote cluster is to use the `kubectl` command because it correctly encodes the data and formats the file.
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic remote-cluster-secret-name -n <secret-namespace> \
      --from-literal=datastoreType=kubernetes \
      --from-file=kubeconfig=<kubeconfig file>
   ```

1. If RBAC is enabled in cluster 1, create a Role and RoleBinding for $[prodname] to use to access the secret that contains the `kubeconfig` for cluster 2:
   ```bash
   kubectl create -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Role
   metadata:
     name: remote-cluster-secret-access
     namespace: <secret-namespace>
   rules:
   - apiGroups: [""]
     resources: ["secrets"]
     verbs: ["watch", "list", "get"]
   ---
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: RoleBinding
   metadata:
     name: remote-cluster-secret-access
     namespace: <secret-namespace>
   roleRef:
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     kind: Role
     name: remote-cluster-secret-access
   subjects:
   - kind: ServiceAccount
     name: calico-typha
     namespace: calico-system
   EOF
   ```

1. Create the RemoteClusterConfiguration in cluster 1:

   Within the RemoteClusterConfiguration, we specify the secret used to access cluster 2, and the overlay routing mode which toggles the establishment of cross-cluster overlay routes.
   ```bash
   kubectl create -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: RemoteClusterConfiguration
   metadata:
     name: cluster-2
   spec:
     clusterAccessSecret:
       name: remote-cluster-secret-name
       namespace: <secret-namespace>
       kind: Secret
     syncOptions:
       overlayRoutingMode: Enabled
   EOF
   ```

1. [Validate](#check-remote-cluster-connection) the that the remote cluster connection can be established.

1. Repeat the above steps, switching cluster 1 and cluster 2.

In this setup, the cluster mesh will rely on the underlying network to provides cross-cluster routing that preserves pod IPs.

       namespace: <secret-namespace>
       kind: Secret
     syncOptions:
       overlayRoutingMode: Disabled
   EOF
   ```

1. If you have no IP pools in cluster 1 with NAT-outgoing enabled, skip this step.

   Otherwise, if you have IP pools in cluster 1 with NAT-outgoing enabled, and workloads in that pool will egress to workloads in cluster 2, you need to instruct $[prodname] to not perform NAT on traffic destined for IP pools in cluster 2.

   You can achieve this by creating a disabled IP pool in cluster 1 for each CIDR in cluster 2. This IP pool should have NAT-outgoing disabled. For example:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: IPPool
    metadata:
      name: cluster2-main-pool
    spec:
      cidr: <Cluster 2 CIDR>
      disabled: true
    ```

1. [Validate](#check-remote-cluster-connection) the that the remote cluster connection can be established.

1. Repeat the above steps, switching cluster 1 and cluster 2.

#### 🎉 Done!
After completing the above steps for all cluster pairs in the cluster mesh, your clusters should now be forming a cluster mesh! You should now be able to route traffic between clusters, and write policy that can select remote workloads.

:::tip[mental model]
A cluster in the mesh can write policy rules that select pods from other clusters in the mesh. This is because traffic from remote clusters has pod IPs preserved, and the local cluster can associate remote pod IPs with the pod specs it synchronized from remote clusters.
:::

## How to

### Switch to multi-cluster networking
The steps above assume that you are configuring both federated endpoint identity and multi-cluster networking for the first time. If you already have federated endpoint identity, and want to use multi-cluster networking, follow these steps:

1. Validate that all [requirements](#calico-enterprise-multi-cluster-networking) for multi-cluster networking have been met.
2. Update the ClusterRole in each cluster in the cluster mesh using the RBAC manifest found in [Generate credentials for cross-cluster authentication](#generate-credentials-for-cross-cluster-resource-synchronization)
3. In all RemoteClusterConfigurations, set `Spec.OverlayRoutingMode` to `Enabled`.
4. Verify that all RemoteClusterConfigurations are bidirectional (in both directions for each cluster pair) using these [instructions](#establish-cross-cluster-resource-synchronization).
5. If you had previously created disabled IP pools to prevent NAT outgoing from applying to remote cluster destinations, those disabled IP pools are no longer needed when using multi-cluster networking and must be deleted.

### Validate federated endpoint identity & multi-cluster networking
#### Validate RemoteClusterConfiguration and federated endpoint identity
##### Check remote cluster connection
You can validate in a local cluster that Typha has synced to the remote cluster through the [Prometheus metrics for Typha](../../reference/component-resources/typha/prometheus#metric-reference).

Alternatively, you can check the Typha logs for remote cluster connection status. Run the following command:
```bash
kubectl logs deployment/calico-typha -n calico-system | grep "Sending in-sync update"
```
You should see an entry for each RemoteClusterConfiguration in the local cluster.

If either output contains unexpected results, proceed to the [troubleshooting](#troubleshoot) section.

#### Validate multi-cluster networking
If all requirements were met for $[prodname] to establish multi-cluster networking, you can test the functionality by establishing a connection from a pod in a local cluster to the IP of a pod in a remote cluster. Ensure that there is no policy in either cluster that may block this connection.

If the connection fails, proceed to the [troubleshooting](#troubleshoot) section.

### Create remote-identity-aware network policy
With federated endpoint identity and routing between clusters established, you can now use labels to reference endpoints on a remote cluster in local policy rules, rather than referencing them by IP address.

The main policy selector still refers only to local endpoints; and that selector chooses which local endpoints to apply the policy.
However, rule selectors can now refer to both local and remote endpoints.

In the following example, cluster A (an application cluster) has a network policy that governs outbound connections to cluster B (a database cluster).
```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
    name: default.app-to-db
    namespace: myapp
spec:
    # The main policy selector selects endpoints from the local cluster only.
    selector: app == 'backend-app'
    tier: default
    egress:
    - destination:
        # Rule selectors can select endpoints from local AND remote clusters.
        selector: app == 'postgres'
      protocol: TCP
      ports: [5432]
      action: Allow
```

### Troubleshoot
#### Troubleshoot RemoteClusterConfiguration and federated endpoint identity

##### Verify configuration
For each impacted remote cluster pair (between cluster A and cluster B):
1. Retrieve the `kubeconfig` from the secret stored in cluster A. Manually verify that it can be used to connect to cluster B.
   ```bash
   kubectl get secret -n <secret-namespace> remote-cluster-secret-name -o=jsonpath="{.data.kubeconfig}" | base64 -d > verify_kubeconfig_b
   kubectl --kubeconfig=verify_kubeconfig_b get nodes
   ```
   This validates that the credentials used by Typha to connect to cluster B's API server are stored in the correct location and provide sufficient access.

   The command above should yield a result like the following:
   ```
    NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
    clusterB-master   Ready    master   7d    v1.27.0
    clusterB-worker-1 Ready    worker   7d    v1.27.0
    clusterB-worker-2 Ready    worker   7d    v1.27.0
   ```

    If you do not see the nodes of cluster B listed in response to the command above, verify that you [created](#generate-credentials-for-cross-cluster-resource-synchronization) the `kubeconfig` for cluster B correctly, and that you [stored](#establish-cross-cluster-resource-synchronization) it in cluster A correctly.

    If you do see the nodes of cluster B listed in response to the command above, you can run this test (or a similar test) on a node in cluster A to verify that cluster A nodes can connect to the API server of cluster B.

2. Validate that the Typha service account in Cluster A is authorized to retrieve the `kubeconfig` secret for cluster B.
   ```bash
    kubectl auth can-i list secrets --namespace <secret-namespace> --as=system:serviceaccount:calico-system:calico-typha
   ```

    This command should yield the following output:
    ```
    yes
    ```

    If the command does not return this output, verify that you correctly [configured RBAC](#establish-cross-cluster-resource-synchronization) in cluster A.

3. Repeat the above, switching cluster A to cluster B.

##### Check logs
Validate that querying Typha logs yield the expected result outlined in the [validation](#validate-federated-endpoint-identity--multi-cluster-networking) section.

If the Typha logs do not yield the expected result, review the warning or error-related logs in `typha` or `calico-node` for insights.

###### calicoq
[calicoq](../../operations/clis/calicoq/installing) can be used to emulate the connection that Typha will make to remote clusters. Use the following command:
```bash
calicoq eval "all()"
```
If all remote clusters are accessible, calicoq returns something like the following. Note the remote cluster prefixes: there should be endpoints prefixed with the name of each RemoteClusterConfiguration in the local cluster.
```
Endpoints matching selector all():
  Workload endpoint remote-cluster-1/host-1/k8s/kube-system.kube-dns-5fbcb4d67b-h6686/eth0
  Workload endpoint remote-cluster-1/host-2/k8s/kube-system.cnx-manager-66c4dbc5b7-6d9xv/eth0
  Workload endpoint host-a/k8s/kube-system.kube-dns-5fbcb4d67b-7wbhv/eth0
  Workload endpoint host-b/k8s/kube-system.cnx-manager-66c4dbc5b7-6ghsm/eth0
```

If this command fails, the error messages returned by the command may provide insight into where issues are occurring.

#### Troubleshoot multi-cluster networking
##### Basic validation
* Ensure that RemoteClusterConfiguration and federated endpoint identity are [functioning correctly](#validate-federated-endpoint-identity--multi-cluster-networking)
* Verify that you have met the [prerequisites](#calico-enterprise-multi-cluster-networking) for multi-cluster networking
* If you had previously set up RemoteClusterConfigurations without multi-cluster networking, and are upgrading to use the feature, review the [switching considerations](#switch-to-multi-cluster-networking)
* Verify that traffic between clusters is not being denied by network policy

##### Check overlayRoutingMode
Ensure that `overlayRoutingMode` is set to `"Enabled"` on all RemoteClusterConfigurations.

If overlay routing is successfully enabled, you can view the logs of a Typha instance using:
```bash
kubectl logs deployment/calico-typha -n calico-system
```

You should see an output for each connected remote cluster that looks like this:
```
18:49:35.394 [INFO][14] wrappedcallbacks.go 443: Creating syncer for RemoteClusterConfiguration(my-cluster)
18:49:35.394 [INFO][14] watchercache.go 186: Full resync is required ListRoot="/calico/ipam/v2/assignment/"
18:49:35.395 [INFO][14] watchercache.go 186: Full resync is required ListRoot="/calico/resources/v3/projectcalico.org/workloadendpoints"
18:49:35.396 [INFO][14] watchercache.go 186: Full resync is required ListRoot="/calico/resources/v3/projectcalico.org/hostendpoints"
18:49:35.396 [INFO][14] watchercache.go 186: Full resync is required ListRoot="/calico/resources/v3/projectcalico.org/profiles"
18:49:35.396 [INFO][14] watchercache.go 186: Full resync is required ListRoot="/calico/resources/v3/projectcalico.org/nodes"
18:49:35.397 [INFO][14] watchercache.go 186: Full resync is required ListRoot="/calico/resources/v3/projectcalico.org/ippools"
```

If you do not see the each of the resource types above, overlay routing was not successfully enabled in your cluster. Verify that you followed the [setup](#establish-cross-cluster-resource-synchronization) correctly for overlay routing, and that the cluster is using a version of $[prodname] that supports multi-cluster networking.

###### Check logs
Warning or error logs in `typha` or `calico-node` may provide insight into where issues are occurring.
