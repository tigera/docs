# Create an ingress gateway

Create an ingress gateway to manage ingress traffic with the Kubernetes Gateway API.

## Creating an ingress gateway with Calico Ingress Gateway

Calico Ingress Gateway is based on Envoy Gateway, an open-source implementation of the Gateway API.
Calico provides a simple, convenient way to deploy and manage this implementation.

Creating an ingress gateway with Calico Ingress Gateway involves only a few steps.
You need to do the following:
* Enable Calico Ingress Gateway by creating a `GatewayAPI` resource.
* Create a `Gateway` resource that references `tigera-gateway-class`, the name of the `GatewayClass` resource created by the Tigera Operator.
* When you create your gateway routing resources, you refer to this `Gateway` resource.

## Limitations

* Calico Ingress Gateway is not supported on Windows nodes.

## Prerequisites

* You have an understanding of the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) and know how you want to configure it for your system.
* $[prodname] was installed on your cluster using the Tigera Operator.
* Your cluster is provisioned to support services of type `LoadBalancer`.

## Create an ingress gateway

1. To enable Gateway API support, create a `GatewayAPI` resource with the name `tigera-secure`:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: GatewayAPI
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   EOF
   ```
   The Tigera Operator pulls and sets up the hardened Envoy Gateway images.
   This gives you a set of Gateway API resources, including the `GatewayClass` resource you need to create your gateway.

   To verify, you can check to see if the `GatewayClass` resource is available:

   ```bash
   kubectl get gatewayclass
   ```
   ```bash title='Expected output'
   NAME                   CONTROLLER                                      ACCEPTED   AGE
   tigera-gateway-class   gateway.envoyproxy.io/gatewayclass-controller   True       4m
   ```
   :::tip
   `tigera-gateway-class` is the name of the single default `GatewayClass` resource that is created when you enable Gateway API support.
   You can define additional gateway classes{/*TODO: Add link with customization doc*/}, along with other customizations, in the `GatewayAPI` resource.
   :::

1. Create a `Gateway` resource that is linked to `tigera-gateway-class`.

   ```yaml title='Example snippet of a Gateway resource with default gatewayClassName'
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
   // highlight-next-line
     name: <gateway-name>
   spec:
   // highlight-next-line
     gatewayClassName: tigera-gateway-class
     ...
   ```
   Replace `<gateway-name>` with a name for your gateway.
   You will refer to this gateway name for all services you want to use the gateway.

1. Create a gateway routing resource that refers to your `Gateway` resource as `.spec.parentRefs`:

    ```yaml title='Example snippet of an HTTPRoute resource'
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: HTTPRoute
    metadata:
      name: example-httproute
    spec:
    // highlight-start
      parentRefs:
        - name: <gateway-name>
    // highlight-end
      ...
    ```
    Replace `<gateway-name>` with the name of your `Gateway` resource.
