# Create and use an ingress gateway

Create an ingress gateway to manage ingress traffic with the Kubernetes Gateway API.

## Prerequisites



## Create an ingress gateway

1. To enable Gateway API support, create a `GatewayAPI` resource with name `default`:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: GatewayAPI
   metadata:
     name: default
   EOF
   ```
   The Tigera Operator deploys Gateway API resources, including the `GatewayClass` resource you need to create your gateway.

   You can verify this:

   ```bash
   kubectl get gatewayclass
   ```
   ```bash title='Expected output'
   NAME                   CONTROLLER                                      ACCEPTED   AGE
   tigera-gateway-class   gateway.envoyproxy.io/gatewayclass-controller   True       144m
   ```

1. Create a `Gateway` resource that is linked to `tigera-gateway-class`.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: <gateway-name>
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: tigera-gateway-class
   ```
   Replace `<gateway-name>` with a name for your gateway.

   You will refer to this gateway name for all services you want to use the gateway.

1. Create a gateway routing resource that refers to your `Gateway` resource as `.spec.parentRefs`:

    ```yaml title='Example HTTPRoute resource
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: HTTPRoute
    metadata:
      name: <route-name>
    spec:
      parentRefs:
        - name: <gateway-name>
    ```
