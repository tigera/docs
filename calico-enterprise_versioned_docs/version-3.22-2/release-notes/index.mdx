# Calico Enterprise 3.22 release notes

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of $[prodname].

This version of Calico Enterprise is based on [Calico Open Source $[openSourceVersion]](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/$[openSourceVersion]/release-notes).

## New features and enhancements

### Calico Ingress Gateway is GA

Calico Ingress Gateway is now supported with general availability.
Calico Ingress Gateway is an enterprise-hardened, 100% upstream distribution of Envoy Gateway. Envoy Gateway is an implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API with several extensions that provide advanced security and traffic management features.

For more information, see [About Calico Ingress Gateway](../networking/ingress-gateway/about-calico-ingress-gateway.mdx).

### Web application firewall for Calico Ingress Gateway

The release adds the ability to configure a web application firewall for Calico Ingress Gateway.

For more information, see [Deploying WAF with an ingress gateway](../threat/deploying-waf-ingress-gateway.mdx).

### External load balancers for Calico Ingress Gateway

This release adds customization options for specifying external load balancers for `Gateway` resources in your cluster.

For more information, see [Customize gateway deployment and features](../networking/ingress-gateway/customize-ingress-gateway.mdx#customize-gateway-deployment-and-features).

### HTTP header-based matching for application layer policies

This release includes support for HTTP header-based matching for application layer policies.
You can now write deny and allow rules for L7 ingress traffic by matching values in HTTP headers.

For more information, see [Global network policy](../reference/resources/globalnetworkpolicy.mdx#httpheadermatch).

### Enhanced visibility for denied pre-DNAT traffic

This update delivers flow logs specifically for denied traffic by Calico pre-DNAT policies.
Now, you can quickly identify and understand why certain traffic is being blocked at the earliest stage of packet processing, greatly simplifying troubleshooting and providing assurance that your pre-DNAT policies are effectively enforcing your desired access controls.

For more information, see [Apply policy to forwarded traffic](../network-policy/hosts/host-forwarded-traffic.mdx).

### Observability tools for non-cluster hosts and VMs

You can now view traffic from connected non-cluster hosts and VMs using observability tools such as Flow Visualizer and Service Graph.
This lets you observe and analyze traffic patterns for all your workloads, regardless of the platform.

For more information about these observability tools, see [Network visualization](../observability/visualize-traffic.mdx).

### Consolidated log forwarding for non-cluster hosts

This release includes a simpler way to forward logs from your non-cluster hosts.
You can now forward these logs from your management cluster, which saves you the burden of configuring access to your data store for each external host.

For more information, see [Archive logs](../observability/elastic/archive-storage.mdx).


{/* Start 3.22.0-2.0 features */}

### External secret provider support

Calico Enterprise now supports loading credentials for external identity providers directly from a CSI Secret Store Driver, eliminating the need to store sensitive client secrets within Kubernetes.
This capability is critical if you have security policies that prohibit creating Kubernetes secrets.

Instead of creating a secret, you can configure a `SecretProviderClass` resource that mounts fields, such as `clientID` and `clientSecret`, directly from your external vault onto the `tigera-dex` pod.
This support is now available for **OIDC**, **Google**, and **LDAP** identity connectors.

For complete configuration instructions, see [Configure an external identity provider](../operations/cnx/configure-identity-provider.mdx).


### Enhanced observability with built-in dashboards (tech preview)

Calico Enterprise now includes a comprehensive set of built-in observability dashboards, making it easier for you to quickly assess cluster activity, network health, and security posture without having to navigate to a separate Kibana instance.

You now have access to the following dashboards in the web console:

* **Cluster Health:** A high-level overview of overall cluster activity.
* **Traffic Volume:** A high-level view of traffic flow within your cluster.
* **Flow Logs:** An overview of packet activity to help spot unusual flows.
* **DNS Logs:** Summarized DNS data for performance and lookup analysis.
* **HTTP Traffic:** Application performance metrics for Kubernetes services, assisting with workload health assessment.
* **Network Performance:** Provides TCP metrics to help identify bottlenecks, packet loss, and performance issues.

For more information, see [Dashboards](../observability/dashboards.mdx).

### High availability for hosts and VMs

Calico Enterprise now supports high availability mode for bare metal hosts and VMs protected by network policy.

This mode enables hosts to automatically fail over to a standby Kubernetes cluster when the primary fails, using an external load balancer to manage traffic.
For this to work, you must use domain names for endpoints and synchronize network policies between the active and passive clusters.
This feature is critical for maintaining continuous policy enforcement and disaster recovery.

For more information, see [Configure high availability mode](../getting-started/bare-metal/about.mdx#configure-high-availability-mode).

{/* End 3.22.0-2.0 features */}

### Enhancements

* To support a minimal footprint and simplify resource management, the API server component and its associated resources
have been moved from the `tigera-system` namespace to the `calico-system` namespace. In addition, in managed clusters
namespaces `tigera-manager`, `tigera-policy-recommendation` and `tigera-elasticsearch` have been removed. Permissions
that were previously bound to service accounts in those namespaces have been moved to Guardian's cluster role.

## Release details

### Calico Enterprise 3.22.0-1.0 (early preview)

August 6, 2025

Calico Enterprise 3.22.0-1.0 is now available as an early preview release.
This release is for previewing and testing purposes only.
It is not supported for use in production.

This Calico Enterprise release is based on [Calico Open Source 3.30](/calico/3.30/release-notes).

#### Known issues

eBPF deployments within MKE fail to properly configure the VXLAN tunnel device. This issue is isolated to eBPF deployments. A fix for this issue will be included in the next release.

### Calico Enterprise 3.22.0-2.0 (early preview)

November 14, 2025

Calico Enterprise 3.22.0-2.0 is now available as an early preview release.
This release is for previewing and testing purposes only.
It is not supported for use in production.

This release adds the following features:
* [External secret provider support](#external-secret-provider-support)
* [Enhanced observability with built-in dashboards (tech preview)](#enhanced-observability-with-built-in-dashboards-tech-preview)
* [High availability for hosts and VMs](#high-availability-for-hosts-and-vms)

This Calico Enterprise release is based on [Calico Open Source 3.31](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/3.31/release-notes).

#### Compatibility notes

* EKS installations using eBPF on Amazon Linux 2 nodes are not currently supported due to a kernel issue on these systems.

#### Enhancements

* The UI now uses the OIDC code flow when communicating with Dex, which is more secure. This affects all external identity providers (OIDC, LDAP, Openshift).
* Added support for custom-signed Calico Node certificates on non-cluster hosts.
* Add Support for IPv4 fragmentation in eBPF mode.

#### Bug fixes

* ***Breaking change***: This release fixes the defaulting behaviour for `Authentication.Spec.OIDC.requestedScopes` such that it now includes `offline_access` as documented in the API. In the unlikely case that your identity provider does not support `offline_access` and if you did previously not specify `requestedScopes`, you should set `requestedScopes` to `[profile, openid, email]`.
* Fixed an issue that prevented the UI from renewing session tokens when using LDAP.
* Fixed an issue where the operator would run into access errors if it was installed in a namespace other than `tigera-operator`.
* Fixed an issue where CSRs need manual deletion if a non-cluster host's CSR was rejected by the certificate signer.
* When IPAM runs out of address space, Calico will try to reclaim empty blocks from other nodes before giving up.
* Avoid writing 0 or negative values to prometheus from linseed, leading to recoverable panics in the logs.

#### Known issues

* Installations on EKS using the eBPF dataplane on AmazonLinux 2023, Bottlerocket, or Flatcar are currently unsupported as these installations may may fail due to a recent kernel change on these systems.
