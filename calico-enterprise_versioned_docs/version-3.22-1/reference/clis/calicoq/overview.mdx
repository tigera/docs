# calicoq

`calicoq` is the $[prodname] policy query utility. It is a command line tool that
makes it easy to check your $[prodname] security policies.
See [Installing calicoq](../../../operations/clis/calicoq/index.mdx) for
how to download and install `calicoq`.

## Datastore configuration

`calicoq` works by querying the $[prodname] datastore. For this configuration calicoq uses exactly the same
setup as `calicoctl`, which means that:

- You can create a YAML or JSON config file, and specify that with `calicoq`'s
  `-c` option. This is the best option if you have already created that file
  for use with `calicoctl`.

- Or you can set environment variables to specify the datastore type and
  location: `DATASTORE_TYPE` and so on.

For more detail, see
[Configuring calicoq](../../../operations/clis/calicoq/configure/index.mdx).

## Commands

The `calicoq` command line interface provides a number of policy inspection
commands to allow you to confirm that your security policies are configured
as intended.

- The [endpoint](endpoint.mdx)
  command shows you the $[prodname] policies and profiles that relate to specified
  endpoints.
- The [eval](eval.mdx) command
  displays the endpoints that a selector selects.
- The [host](host.mdx) command
  displays the policies and profiles that are relevant to all endpoints on a
  given host.
- The [policy](policy.mdx)
  command shows the endpoints that are relevant to a given policy.
- The [version](version.mdx)
  command displays the version of the tool.

Usage:
  calicoq [--debug] [--config=<config>] eval <selector>
  calicoq [--debug] [--config=<config>] policy <policy-name> [--hide-selectors|-s] [--hide-rule-matches|-r]
  calicoq [--debug] [--config=<config>] endpoint <substring> [--hide-selectors|-s] [--hide-rule-matches|-r]
  calicoq [--debug] [--config=<config>] host <hostname> [--hide-selectors|-s] [--hide-rule-matches|-r]
  calicoq [--debug] version

Description:
  The calicoq command line tool is used to check Calico security policies.

  calicoq eval <selector> is used to display the endpoints that are matched by <selector>.

  calicoq policy <policy-name> shows the endpoints that are relevant to the named policy,
  comprising:
  - the endpoints that the policy applies to (for which ingress or egress traffic is policed
    according to the rules in that policy)
  - the endpoints that match the policy's rule selectors (that are allowed or disallowed as data
    sources or destinations).

  calicoq endpoint <substring> shows you the Calico policies and profiles that relate to endpoints
  whose full ID includes <substring>.

  calicoq host <hostname> shows you the endpoints that are hosted on <hostname> and all the Calico
  policies and profiles that relate to those endpoints.

Notes:
  When specifying a namespaced NetworkPolicy name, the namespace should also be included by
  specifying the <policy-name> in the format "<namespace>/<policy-name>". If the namespace is
  omitted it is assumed the name refers to a GlobalNetworkPolicy.

  When a Calico policy is mapped from a Kubernetes resource, the name will be prefixed with
  "knp.default". For example to query the Kubernetes NetworkPolicy "test-policy" in the Namespace
  "demo-ns" use the following command:
      calicoq policy demo-ns/knp.default.test-policy

  For an endpoint, the full Calico ID is "<host>/<orchestrator>/<workload-name>/<endpoint-name>".
  In the Kubernetes case "<orchestrator>" is always "k8s", "<workload-name>" is "<pod
  namespace>.<pod name>", and "<endpoint-name>" is always "eth0".

Options:
  -c <config> --config=<config>  Path to the file containing connection
                                 configuration in YAML or JSON format.
                                 [default: /etc/calico/calicoctl.cfg]

  -r --hide-rule-matches         Don't show the list of policies and profiles whose
                                 rule selectors match the specified endpoint (or an
                                 endpoint on the specified host) as an allowed or
                                 disallowed source/destination.

  -s --hide-selectors            Don't show the detailed selector expressions involved
                                 (that cause each displayed policy or profile to apply to or match
                                 various endpoints).

  -d --debug                     Log debugging information to stderr.

  -o <output> --output=<output>  Output format. Either yaml, json, or ps.
                                 [default: ps]
```
