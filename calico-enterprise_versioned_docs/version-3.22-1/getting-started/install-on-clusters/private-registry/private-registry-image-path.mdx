# Install from an image path in a private registry

## Big picture

Move Calico Enterprise container images to an image path in a private registry and configure $[prodname] to pull images from it.

## Value

Install Calico Enterprise in clusters where pulling from third party private repos is not an option, and all images are desired to be part of a single directory in the private registry.

## Concepts

A **container image registry** (often referred to as a **registry**) is a service where container images are pushed to, stored, and pulled from. A registry is said to be "private" if it requires users authenticate before accessing images.

An **image path** is a directory in the private registry that contains images required to install $[prodname].

An **image pull secret** is used in Kubernetes to deploy container images from a private container image registry.

## Before you begin...

- Configure pull access to your private registry
- [Configure pull access to Tigera's private container registry](../calico-enterprise.mdx#get-private-registry-credentials-and-license-key).
- Use the [Crane command](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/README.md) to manage the $[prodnameWindows] images, as using `docker pull` commands for these images may not work depending on the operating system and version in which the commands are run.

## How to

- [Push $[prodname] images to your private registry](#push-calico-enterprise-images-to-your-private-registry-image-path)
- [Run the operator using images from your private registry](#run-the-operator-using-images-from-your-private-registry-image-path)
- [Configure the operator to use images from your private registry](#configure-the-operator-to-use-images-from-your-private-registry-image-path)
