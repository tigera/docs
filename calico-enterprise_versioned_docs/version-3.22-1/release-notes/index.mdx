# Calico Enterprise 3.22 release notes

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of $[prodname].

This version of Calico Enterprise is based on [Calico Open Source $[openSourceVersion]](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/$[openSourceVersion]/release-notes).

## New features and enhancements

### Calico Ingress Gateway is GA

Calico Ingress Gateway is now supported with general availability.
Calico Ingress Gateway is an enterprise-hardened, 100% upstream distribution of Envoy Gateway. Envoy Gateway is an implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API with several extensions that provide advanced security and traffic management features.

For more information, see [Configure an ingress gateway](../networking/gateway-api.mdx).

### Web application firewall for Calico Ingress Gateway

The release adds the ability to configure a web application firewall for Calico Ingress Gateway.

For more information, see [Deploying WAF with an ingress gateway](../threat/deploying-waf-ingress-gateway.mdx).

### External load balancers for Calico Ingress Gateway

This release adds customization options for specifying external load balancers for `Gateway` resources in your cluster.

For more information, see [Customize gateway deployment and features](../networking/gateway-api.mdx#customize-gateway-deployment-and-features).

### HTTP header-based matching for application layer policies

This release includes support for HTTP header-based matching for application layer policies.
You can now write deny and allow rules for L7 ingress traffic by matching values in HTTP headers.

For more information, see [Global network policy](../reference/resources/globalnetworkpolicy.mdx#httpheadermatch).

### Enhanced visibility for denied pre-DNAT traffic

This update delivers flow logs specifically for denied traffic by Calico pre-DNAT policies.
Now, you can quickly identify and understand why certain traffic is being blocked at the earliest stage of packet processing, greatly simplifying troubleshooting and providing assurance that your pre-DNAT policies are effectively enforcing your desired access controls.

For more information, see [Apply policy to forwarded traffic](../network-policy/hosts/host-forwarded-traffic.mdx).

### Observability tools for non-cluster hosts and VMs

You can now view traffic from connected non-cluster hosts and VMs using observability tools such as Flow Visualizer and Service Graph.
This lets you observe and analyze traffic patterns for all your workloads, regardless of the platform.

For more information about these observability tools, see [Network visualization](../observability/visualize-traffic.mdx).

### Consolidated log forwarding for non-cluster hosts

This release includes a simpler way to forward logs from your non-cluster hosts.
You can now forward these logs from your management cluster, which saves you the burden of configuring access to your data store for each external host.

For more information, see [Archive logs](../observability/elastic/archive-storage.mdx).

### Enhancements

* To support a minimal footprint and simplify resource management, the API server component and its associated resources
have been moved from the `tigera-system` namespace to the `calico-system` namespace. In addition, in managed clusters
namespaces `tigera-manager`, `tigera-policy-recommendation` and `tigera-elasticsearch` have been removed. Permissions
that were previously bound to service accounts in those namespaces have been moved to Guardian's cluster role.
