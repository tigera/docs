# Decommission a node

## About decommissioning nodes

If you are running the [node controller](../reference/component-resources/kube-controllers/configuration.mdx)
or using the Kubernetes API datastore in policy-only mode, you do not need to manually decommission nodes.

In other configurations, you may need to manually decommission a node for one
of the following reasons.

- You are decommissioning a host running `$[nodecontainer]` or removing it from your
  cluster.
- You are renaming a node.
- You are receiving an error about an IP address already in use.
- Readiness checks are failing due to unreachable peers that are no longer in the
  cluster.
- Hosts are regularly added and removed from your cluster.

## Purpose of this page

Provide guidance on how to remove a host that is part of a $[prodname] cluster
and clean up the associated [Node resource](../reference/resources/node)
information.

## Prerequisites

- Prior to removing any Node resource from the datastore the `$[nodecontainer]`
  container should be stopped on the corresponding host and it should be
  ensured that it will not be restarted.
- You must have [calicoctl configured](../operations/clis/calicoctl/install) and operational to run
  the commands listed here.

## Removing a node resource

Removing a Node resource will also remove the Workload Endpoint, Host
Endpoint, and IP Address resources and any other sub configuration items
associated with that Node.

:::note

- Deleting a Node resource may be service impacting if the host is still in
  service. Ensure that the host is no longer in service before deleting the
  Node resource.
- Any configuration specific to the node will be removed. This would be
  configuration like node BGP peerings or custom Felix configs.

:::

## Removing a single node resource

See the example below for how to remove a node with the calicoctl command.

See [Removing a Node resource](#removing-a-node-resource) above.

```bash
calicoctl delete node <nodeName>
```

## Removing multiple node resources

To remove several Nodes, a file can be created with several Node resources and
then be passed to the `calicoctl delete` command with the `-f` flag.
Below is an example of how to create a file of Nodes and delete them.

1. Create a file with the [Node resources](../reference/resources/node) that need
   to be removed. For example:

   ```yaml
   - apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
     kind: Node
     metadata:
       name: node-02
   - apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
     kind: Node
     metadata:
       name: node-03
   ```

2. To delete the nodes listed in the file pass it like below.

   :::caution

   See [Removing a Node resource](#removing-a-node-resource) above.

   :::

   ```bash
   calicoctl delete -f nodes_to_delete.yaml
   ```
