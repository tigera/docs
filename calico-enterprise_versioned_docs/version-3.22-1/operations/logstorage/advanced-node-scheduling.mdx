# Advanced Node Scheduling

## Big picture

$[prodname] can leverage advanced Kubernetes node scheduling options and advanced Elasticsearch shard scheduling
options to allow you to customize the distribution of the Elasticsearch pods and replicas across Kubernetes nodes with
specific attributes.

## Value

In some scenarios you may want to control where the Elasticsearch pods and replicas are scheduled. DataNodeSelectors and
SelectionAttributes have been designed to add this flexibility.

To make sure that all the Elasticsearch pods are scheduled on Kubernetes nodes with specific attributes, use dataNodeSelectors
and specify the labels a Kubernetes node must have in order for it to be eligible for an Elasticsearch pod to be scheduled on it.

To protect the Elasticsearch cluster from failing if certain Kubernetes nodes fail, use SelectionAttributes. Elasticsearch
pods and replicas will be distributed across nodes with different node labels, ensuring that in the event of Kubernetes
node failure all the Elasticsearch data will still be available.

## How to

### Schedule LogStorage using dataNodeSelectors

The $[prodname] [LogStorageSpec](../../reference/installation/api.mdx) has the field `dataNodeSelector`,
which is a map where the keys are label names and values are label values. The Elasticsearch pods used by $[prodname]
will only be scheduled on Kubernetes nodes that match **all** labels.

1.  Add the labels to your `LogStorage`.
    `batch kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1 kind: LogStorage metadata: name: tigera-secure spec: nodes: count: 1 dataNodeSelector: label1: value1 label2: value2 EOF `
    A new Elasticsearch pod will now be created in namespace `tigera-elasticsearch`, but will remain `PENDING` until there is
    a Kubernetes node that matches the labels.

1.  Label one of your Kubernetes Nodes
    ```bash
    kubectl label nodes <your-node-name> label1=value1
    kubectl label nodes <your-node-name> label2=value2
    ```
1.  Monitor the progress.
    ```bash
    kubectl get pod -o wide -n tigera-elasticsearch -w
    ```

### Make LogStorage zone-aware using selectionAttributes

If you are in a situation where your cluster has nodes across three regions, you can make sure your Elasticsearch pods
and replicas are spread evenly among the three regions to ensure the Elasticsearch cluster is intact during zone failure.
Consider these Kubernetes nodes:

- Nodes in zone A have label `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone: zone-a`.
- Nodes in zone B have label `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone: zone-b`.
- Nodes in zone C have label `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone: zone-c`.

We can now use a LogStorage with three node sets that will all form one cluster. For each node set add `selectionAttributes` object,
such that:

- **NodeLabel** represents a label that should be found on a Kubernetes node for it to be scheduled on.
- **Value** represents the value for `nodeLabel`.
- **Name** represents a unique label for this selection attribute.

It is important to have at least one replica of each shard to make sure that no data can get lost.

1.  Apply the following `LogStorage` manifest.
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
    kind: LogStorage
    metadata:
      name: tigera-secure
    spec:
      indices:
        replicas: 1
      nodes:
        count: 6
        nodeSets:
        - selectionAttributes:
          - name: zone
            nodeLabel: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
            value: zone-a
        - selectionAttributes:
          - name: zone
            nodeLabel: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
            value: zone-b
        - selectionAttributes:
          - name: zone
            nodeLabel: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
            value: zone-c
    EOF
    ```
1.  Verify that the nodes are evenly distributed over the three zones, with the sum of the nodes equal to `count: 6`.
    ```bash
    kubectl get pod -o wide
