# Configure calicoctl

## Big picture

Learn how to configure the calicoctl CLI tool for your cluster.

## Value

The `calicoctl` CLI tool provides helpful administrative commands for interacting with a $[prodname] cluster.

## Concepts

### Default calicoctl behavior

Most `calicoctl` commands require access to the $[prodname] datastore. By default, calicoctl
will attempt to read from the Kubernetes API based on the default kubeconfig.

## How to

### Configure access using a Configuration file

By default, `calicoctl` will look for a configuration file at `/etc/calico/calicoctl.cfg`. You can override this using the `--config` option with commands that require datastore access.
The file can be in either YAML or JSON format. It must be valid and readable by `calicoctl`. For example:

```yaml noValidation
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: CalicoAPIConfig
metadata:
spec:
  datastoreType: "etcdv3"
  etcdEndpoints: "http://etcd1:2379,http://etcd2:2379"
  ...
```

### Configure access using environment variables

If `calicoctl` cannot locate, read, or access a configuration file, it will check a specific set of environment variables.

For a full set of options and examples, see [Configure calicoctl to connect to the datastore](datastore.mdx)

:::note

When running `calicoctl` inside a container, any environment variables and
configuration files must be passed to the container so they are available to
the process inside. It can be useful to keep a running container (that sleeps) configured
for your datastore, then it is possible to `exec` into the container and have an
already configured environment.
