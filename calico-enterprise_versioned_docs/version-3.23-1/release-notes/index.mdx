:::info early preview release

Calico Enterprise 3.23 can be used for previewing and testing purposes only.
It is not supported for use in production.

:::

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of $[prodname].

This version of Calico Enterprise is based on [Calico Open Source $[openSourceVersion]](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/$[openSourceVersion]/release-notes).

## New features and enhancements

### Track unused policies with policy activity logs

New policy activity logs provide clear visibility into exactly when each security policy or rule was last used by network traffic.
This makes it easy to identify and remove outdated rules that are no longer needed, ensuring your cluster remains lean and secure.
By highlighting these unused policies, you can more effectively maintain a "least privilege" security posture and ensure that only necessary traffic is permitted in your environment.

For more information, see [Policy activity logs](../observability/elastic/policy-activity.mdx).

### New Linux distros for non-cluster hosts and VMs

This release adds support for Debian and Ubuntu for non-cluster hosts and VMs.

For more information, see [Install Calico Enterprise on non-cluster hosts and VMs](../getting-started/bare-metal/about.mdx).

### Ingress Gateway dashboard

The Ingress Gateway L7 dashboard provides a clear view of how your gateways manage traffic, helping you track request speeds and resolve connection errors quickly to keep your applications running smoothly.

For more information, see [Dashboards](../observability/dashboards.mdx#ingress-gateway-l7).

### Enhancements

* Improved the deterministic selection logic for flow and L7 logs when multiple NetworkSets have overlapping CIDRs.
  Logs and Service Graph now prioritize namespace-specific matches over GlobalNetworkSets and other namespace matches to ensure more accurate identity attribution.
* User experience improvements to the Flow Summary card.

## Deprecated and removed features

The following features are deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release:

* Support for the following operating systems:
  * RHEL 8
  * Windows 1809
* Support for the x86-64 v2 chip architecture.
* Application-layer policy and L7 observability features based on Envoy as a daemonset.
  (These are being replaced with similar functionality using Istio Ambient Mode.)

## Known issues

* In clusters using the eBPF data plane with strict reverse path forwarding (RPF) enabled, link-local discovery packets may be incorrectly dropped.
  This can prevent the interface from being assigned an IP address, leading to disruptions in host networking.
  This issue will be resolved in the next release.
