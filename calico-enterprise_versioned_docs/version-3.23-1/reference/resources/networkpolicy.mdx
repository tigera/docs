A network policy resource (`NetworkPolicy`) represents an ordered set of rules which are applied
to a collection of endpoints that match a [label selector](#selector).

`NetworkPolicy` is a namespaced resource. `NetworkPolicy` in a specific namespace
only applies to [workload endpoint resources](workloadendpoint.mdx)
in that namespace. Two resources are in the same namespace if the `namespace`
value is set the same on both.
See [global network policy resource](globalnetworkpolicy.mdx) for non-namespaced network policy.

`NetworkPolicy` resources can be used to define network connectivity rules between groups of $[prodname] endpoints and host endpoints, and
take precedence over [profile resources](profile.mdx) if any are defined.

NetworkPolicies are organized into [tiers](tier.mdx), which provide an additional layer of ordering—in particular, note that the `Pass` action skips to the
next [tier](tier.mdx), to enable hierarchical security policy.

For `kubectl` [commands](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/), the following case-insensitive aliases
may be used to specify the resource type on the CLI:
`networkpolicy.projectcalico.org`, `networkpolicies.projectcalico.org` and abbreviations such as
`networkpolicy.p` and `networkpolicies.p`.

## Sample YAML

This sample policy allows TCP traffic from `frontend` endpoints to port 6379 on
`database` endpoints.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: internal-access.allow-tcp-6379
  namespace: production
spec:
  tier: internal-access
  selector: role == 'database'
  types:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      metadata:
        annotations:
          from: frontend
          to: database
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: role == 'frontend'
      destination:
        ports:
          - 6379
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

### Performance Hints

Performance hints provide a way to tell $[prodname] about the intended use of the policy so that it may
process it more efficiently.  Currently only one hint is defined:

* `AssumeNeededOnEveryNode`: normally, $[prodname] only calculates a policy's rules and selectors on nodes where
  the policy is actually in use (i.e. its selector matches a local endpoint).  This saves work in most cases.
  The `AssumeNeededOnEveryNode` hint tells $[prodname] to treat the policy as "in use" on *every* node.  This is
  useful for large policy sets that are known to apply to all (or nearly all) endpoints.  It effectively "preloads"
  the policy on every node so that there is less work to do when the first endpoint matching the policy shows up.
  It also prevents work from being done to tear down the policy when the last endpoint is drained.

## Application layer policy

Application layer policy is an optional feature of $[prodname] and
[must be enabled](../../network-policy/application-layer-policies/alp.mdx)
to use the following match criteria.

:::note

Application layer policy match criteria are supported with the following restrictions.

- Only ingress policy is supported. Egress policy must not contain any application layer policy match clauses.
- Rules must have the action `Allow` if they contain application layer policy match clauses.

## Supported operations

| Datastore type           | Create/Delete | Update | Get/List | Notes |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| Kubernetes API datastore | Yes           | Yes    | Yes      |

#### List filtering on tiers

List and watch operations may specify label selectors or field selectors to filter `NetworkPolicy` resources on tiers returned by the API server.
When no selector is specified, the API server returns all `NetworkPolicy` resources from all tiers that the user has access to.

##### Field selector

When using the field selector, supported operators are `=` and `==`

The following example shows how to retrieve all `NetworkPolicy` resources in the default tier and in all namespaces:

```bash
kubectl get networkpolicy.p --field-selector spec.tier=default --all-namespaces
```

##### Label selector

When using the label selector, supported operators are `=`, `==` and `IN`.

The following example shows how to retrieve all `NetworkPolicy` resources in the `default` and `net-sec` tiers and in all namespaces:

```bash
kubectl get networkpolicy.p -l 'projectcalico.org/tier in (default, net-sec)' --all-namespaces
```
