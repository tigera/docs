# Get started with IP address management

## Big picture

Understand how IP address management (IPAM) functions in a Kubernetes cluster using {variables.prodname}.

## Value

Different IPAM techniques provide different feature sets. {variables.prodname}’s IPAM provides additional IP allocation efficiency and flexibility compared to other address management approaches.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following {variables.prodname} features:

- **{variables.prodname} IPAM**
- **Integration with host-local IPAM**
- **IPPool resource**

## Concepts

### IPAM in Kubernetes

Kubernetes uses IPAM plugins to allocate and manage IP addresses assigned to pods. Different IPAM plugins provide different feature sets. {variables.prodname} provides its own IPAM plugin called **calico-ipam** which is designed to work well with {variables.prodname} and includes a number of features.

### {variables.prodname} IPAM

The **calico-ipam** plugin uses {variables.prodname}’s IP pool resource to control how IP addresses are allocated to pods within the cluster. This is the default plugin used by most {variables.prodname} installations.

By default, {variables.prodname} uses a single IP pool for the entire Kubernetes pod CIDR, but you can divide the pod CIDR into several pools. You can assign separate IP pools to particular selections of **nodes**, or to teams, users, or applications within a cluster using **namespaces**.

You can control which pools {variables.prodname} uses for each pod using

- node selectors
- an annotation on the pod’s namespace, or
- an annotation on the pod

{variables.prodname} also supports the **host-local** IPAM plugin. However, when using the host-local IPAM plugin some {variables.prodname} features are not available.

### {variables.prodname} IPAM blocks

In {variables.prodname} IPAM, IP pools are subdivided into blocks -- smaller chunks that are associated with a particular node in the cluster. Each node in the cluster can have one or more blocks associated with it. {variables.prodname} will automatically create and destroy blocks as needed as the number of nodes and pods in the cluster grows or shrinks.

Blocks allow {variables.prodname} to efficiently aggregate addresses assigned to pods on the same node, reducing the size of the routing table. By default {variables.prodname} will try to allocate IP addresses from within an associated block, creating a new block if necessary. {variables.prodname} can also assign addresses to pods on a node that are not within a block associated with that node. This allows for IP allocations independent of the node on which a pod is launched.

By default, {variables.prodname} creates blocks with room for 64 addresses (a /26), but you can control block sizes for each IP pool.

### Host-local IPAM

The host-local plugin is a simple IP address management plugin. It uses predetermined CIDRs statically allocated to each node in order to choose addresses for pods. Once set, the CIDR for a node cannot be modified. Pods can be assigned addresses only from within the CIDR allocated to the node.

{variables.prodname} can use the host-local IPAM plugin, using the **Node.Spec.PodCIDR** field in the Kubernetes API to determine the CIDR to use for each node. However, per-node, per-pod, and per-namespace IP allocation features are not available using the host-local plugin.

The host-local IPAM plugin is primarily used by other methods of routing pod traffic from one host to another. For example, it is used when installing {variables.prodname} for policy enforcement with flannel networking, as well as when using {variables.prodname} in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

## Before you begin

**Limitations**

- Works for platforms that use the Calico CNI

## How to

### Install {variables.prodname} with calico-ipam

Follow one of the getting started guides to install {variables.prodname}.
<!-- TODO-XREFS-CC -->

### Install {variables.prodname} with host-local IPAM

Follow one of the getting started guides to install {variables.prodname}.
