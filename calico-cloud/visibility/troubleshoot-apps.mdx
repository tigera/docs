Modern applications often integrate with third-party APIs and SaaS services that live outside Kubernetes clusters. To securely enable access to those integrations, you must be able to limit IP ranges for egress and ingress traffic to workloads. Limiting IP lists or ranges is also used to deny-list bad actors or embargoed countries. To limit IP ranges, you need to use the Calico Cloud resource called network sets.

To learn how to use the power of networksets, see [Understanding network sets](../get-started/tutorials/networksets.mdx).
