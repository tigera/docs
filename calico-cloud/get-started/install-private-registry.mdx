# Connect a cluster to Calico Cloud using a private registry

You can perform a Helm installation from images stored on a private registry.

## Prerequisites

* You have an active Calico Cloud account. You can sign up for a 14-day free trial at [calicocloud.io](https://calicocloud.io).
* You are signed in to the Calico Cloud Manager UI as a user with the **Owner**, **Admin**, or **DevOps** role.
* You have at least one cluster that meets our [system requirements](system-requirements.mdx).
* You have kubectl access to the cluster.
* You have installed Helm 3.0 or later on your workstation.
* You have [added the Calico Cloud images to a private registry](setup-private-registry.mdx), and you have the following information about the registry:
  * Registry secret name
    :::note
    If your private registry requires credentials, create a `calico-cloud` namespace on your cluster.
    Then, create an image pull secret and use this name for the **Registry Secret Name**.
    :::
  * Image registry
  * Image path


## Install Calico Cloud using a private registry

1. From the **Managed Clusters** page, click **Connect Cluster**.
1. In the **Connect a Cluster** dialog, enter a **Cluster Name** and select a **Cluster Type**.
1. Optional: If you must install a specific older release, select the Calico Cloud version you want to install. We always recommend the latest version, which is installed by default.
1. Click **Advanced Options**, and then select both **Install via helm** and **Private registry**.
1. Enter the **Registry Secret Name**, **Image registry**, and **Image path**.
1. Click **Connect** to generate a unique Helm installation command. Copy the command.
1. Optional: To make changes to what features are enabled during installation, paste the command to a text editor and append the `--set` option any of the following key-value pairs.
   You can change these options only by reinstalling or upgrading Calico Cloud and changing the values.

   | Feature | Key | Values |
   |---------|-----|--------|
   | Image Assurance | `installer.components.imageAssurance.state` | `Enabled` (default), `Disabled` |
   | Container Threat Detection | `installer.components.runtimeSecurity.state` | `Enabled`, `Disabled` (default*) <br/> * The default for new clusters is `Disabled`. For upgrades for previously connected clusters, the default will retain the previous state.|
   | Security Posture Dashboard | `installer.components.securityPosture.state` | `Enabled` (default), `Disabled` |

   ```bash title="Example of generated Helm command with user-added parameters"
   helm repo add calico-cloud https://installer.calicocloud.io/charts --force-update && helm upgrade --install calico-cloud-crds calico-cloud/calico-cloud-crds --namespace calico-cloud --create-namespace && helm upgrade --install calico-cloud calico-cloud/calico-cloud --namespace calico-cloud --set apiKey=ryl34elz8:5kdv6siag:ifk1uwruwlgp7vzn7ecijt5zjbf5p9p1il1ag8877ylwjo4muu19wzg2g8x5qa7x --set installer.clusterName=my-cluster --set installer.calicoCloudVersion=v19.1.0 \
   --set installer.components.imageAssurance.state=Enabled \
   --set installer.components.runtimeSecurity.state=Enabled \
   --set installer.components.securityPosture.state=Enabled
   ```
   In this example, this command connects the cluster to Calico Cloud with Image Assurance, Runtime Security, and Security Posture Dashboard features enabled.1. From a terminal, paste and run the command.

1. On the **Managed Clusters** page, you should immediately see your cluster in the list of managed clusters.
   Monitor the status under **Connection Status**.
   When the status changes to **Connected**, installation is complete and your cluster is connected to Calico Cloud.
