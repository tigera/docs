# RKE requirements

## Verify system requirements

Although {{prodname}} checks that your cluster meets [System requirements](system-requirements.mdx), verifying now can save you time troubleshooting.

## Verify RKE version and settings

1. Verify the RKE version.

   {{prodname}} supports:

   - Rancher Kubernetes Engine 1.3

1. Verify that your cluster is configured with the networking plugin field set to:

   - `calico`
   - `canal`
   - `none`, and your cluster is installed with a compatible version of Calico

   :::note

   If your cluster is configured with the networking plugin `calico` or `canal` you must edit the configuration and switch it to `none` to ensure future updates do not attempt to manage the networking configuration.

   :::

## Verify IAM permissions

Verify that your user account has IAM permissions to create Kubernetes ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, Deployments, Service Accounts, and Custom Resource Definitions. The easiest way to grant permissions is to assign the "Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role‚Äù to your user account. For help, see [RKE access control](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac).
