### Verify system requirements

Although {{site.prodname}} checks that your cluster meets [System requirements]({{sitebase.url}}/get-started/requirements/system-requirements), verifying now can save you time troubleshooting.  

### Verify RKE2 settings

1. Verify you have a compatible {% include open-new-window.html text='RKE2 cluster' url='https://docs.rke2.io/' %}.

1. On your RKE2 cluster, configure the plugin setting to: `no CNI plugin` using any of the following methods. For help, see {% include open-new-window.html text='Configure your cluster with a CNI plugin' url='https://docs.rke2.io/install/install_options/install_options/' %}.
 
    >**Note**: If you have a Calico open source cluster, you must manually install Calico before you can connect it to {{site.prodname}}. Why? RKE2 clusters can be created without a CNI, and {{site.prodname}} requires a CNI. 
    {: .alert .alert-info}  

    - RKE2 CLI: `--cni none`

    - Installation script: `RKE2_CNI=none`  

    - {% include open-new-window.html text='Configuration file' url='https://docs.rke2.io/install/install_options/install_options/#configuration-file' %}: `cni: none`

### Verify IAM permissions

Verify that your user account has IAM permissions to create Kubernetes ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, Deployments, Service Accounts, and Custom Resource Definitions. The easiest way to grant permissions is to assign the "Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role‚Äù to your user account. For help, see {% include open-new-window.html text='RKE access control' url='https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac' %}.
