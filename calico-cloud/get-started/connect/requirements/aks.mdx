# AKS requirements

## Verify system requirements

Although {{prodname}} checks that your cluster meets [System requirements](system-requirements.mdx), verifying now can save you time troubleshooting.

## Verify AKS settings

1. Check that you're using a supported CNI and network policy configuration by running the following command on your AKS cluster:

   ```bash
   az aks show --query 'networkProfile'
   ```

   You must have one of the following combinations of values for`networkPlugin` and `networkPolicy`:

   - `"networkPlugin": "none"` and `"networkPolicy": null`
   - `"networkPlugin": "azure"` and `"networkPolicy": null`
   - `"networkPlugin": "azure"` and `"networkPolicy": "calico"`

1. Verify that transparent mode is being used by running one of the following commands.

   `cat /etc/cni/net.d/*`

   OR

   ```bash
   az vmss run-command invoke -g <resource-group> -n <vmss-name> --scripts "cat /etc/cni/net.d/*" --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --query 'value[0].message'
   ```

   If the Azure CNI is enabled, the output should include `"mode": "transparent"`.

For help in the Azure portal, see [Azure CNI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni) in [transparent mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/faq#what-is-azure-cni-transparent-mode-vs-bridge-mode).

## Verify IAM permissions

Verify that your user account has IAM permissions to create Kubernetes ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, Deployments, Service Accounts, and Custom Resource Definitions. The easiest way to grant permissions is to assign the "Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role‚Äù to your user account. For help, see [AKS access control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/control-kubeconfig-access).

## Verify AddonManager is compatible

If the AKS cluster already has Calico installed and is managed by AKS it may still be compatible with {{prodname}}.
If output from the following command includes "EnsureExists" then the install is compatible with {{prodname}}.

```bash
kubectl get CustomResourceDefinition installations.operator.tigera.io -o yaml | grep ' addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode:'
```

:::note

If the command output does not include "EnsureExists" and you are on a recent version of AKS your cluster might still be compatible.
Please click the question icon in Manager UI under the user icon in the upper right to get help from Support:

:::

:::warning

If your cluster already has Calico installed by AKS and managed by AddonManager, the standard [uninstall](../../../operations/disconnect)
is not supported. You will need to reach out to support to create a plan to uninstall {{prodname}}.

## Remove taints from Linux node pools

Hybrid clusters on AKS may have taints applied to Linux nodes that prevent {{prodname}} from scheduling pods on those nodes.
These taints must be removed before you connect your cluster to {{prodname}}.

You can check whether any node pools in your cluster have taints by running the following command:

```bash
az aks nodepool list --resource-group <group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --query "[].{name:name nodeTaints:nodeTaints}"
```

Remove any taints in the Linux node pools by running the command:

```bash
az aks nodepool update --resource-group <group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --name <nodepool-name> --node-taints ""
```
