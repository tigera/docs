### About the installation wizard

You connect your cluster to {{site.prodname}} using an installation wizard. The wizard verifies that you have a compatible cluster and directs you to the following docs to prepare your cluster.  

- [System requirements]({{site.baseurl}}/get-started/connect/system-requirements)

Additional steps for these platforms:

- [AKS]({{site.baseurl}}/get-started/connect/aks)
- [GKE]({{site.baseurl}}/get-started/connect/gke)
- [RKE]({{site.baseurl}}/get-started/connect/rke)
- [RKE2]({{site.baseurl}}/get-started/connect/rke2)

If you are curious about what happens under the covers during installation, see [What happens when you connect a cluster]({{site.baseurl}}/get-started/connect/connect-cluster).
