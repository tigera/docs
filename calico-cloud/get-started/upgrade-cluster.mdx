# Upgrade Calico Cloud

To upgrade managed clusters to the latest version of $[prodname]:

1. From the web console, go to **Managed Clusters**.
1. For the cluster you want to upgrade, select **Actions** > **Reinstall**.
1. In the **Reinstall Cluster** dialog, select a newer version of $[prodname] from the list, click **Reinstall**, and copy the generated kubectl command.
   <details>
     <summary>Use alternate manifest for legacy features</summary>

     The Image Assurance, Container Threat Detection, and Compliance Reports features were removed for new users in Calico Cloud 21.1.0.
     Legacy users of those features can continue to use a deprecated version until the features are completely removed in a future release.

     To continue using these features, modify the generated command by replacing **two instances** of `deploy.yaml` with `deploy-with-container-security.yaml`.
     This change gives you a manifest with all three legacy features enabled.
     You cannot enable or disable these features individually.

     ```bash title="Example of generated kubectl command with alternate manifest"
     kubectl apply -f https://installer.calicocloud.io/manifests/cc-operator/latest/deploy-with-container-security.yaml && curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ..." "https://www.calicocloud.io/api/managed-cluster/deploy-with-container-security.yaml?version=$[cloudUserVersion]" | kubectl apply -f -
     ```
   </details>

1. From a terminal, paste and run the command.
   The cluster's status under **Connection Status** changes to **Disconnected: Installing**.
   When the upgrade is complete, the status changes to **Connected**.
