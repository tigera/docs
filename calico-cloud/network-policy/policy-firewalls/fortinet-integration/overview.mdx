# Determine the best Calico Cloud/Fortinet solution

## Big picture

Determine the best {{prodname}}/Fortinet solution to integrate Kubernetes clusters with your existing Fortinet firewall workflows.

## Value

Many security teams must work within the confines of their existing IT security architecture, even though perimeter firewalls do not meet the needs of Kubernetes clusters. The {{prodname}}/Fortinet integration allows firewall administrators to leverage existing Fortinet security tools and workflows, continue meeting compliance requirements, while adopting Kubernetes orchestration using {{prodname}} at their own pace.

### Concepts

The {{prodname}}/Fortinet integration provides the following solutions. You can you use them separately, or together without contention.

### Solution 1: Extend Kubernetes to Fortinet firewall devices

**Use case**: Control egress traffic for Kubernetes clusters.

**Problem**: Perimeter firewalls do not have the necessary information to act on traffic that leaves the cluster for Kubernetes workloads.

**Solution**: The {{prodname}}/Fortinet integration leverages the power of {{prodname}} policy selectors to provide Kubernetes workload information to FortiManager and FortiGate devices. You create perimeter firewall policies in FortiManager and FortiGate that reference Kuberetes workloads. Policies are applied and enforced by FortiGate devices. And Firewall administrators can write cluster egress policies that reference Kubernetes workloads directly in Fortinet devices.

### Solution 2: Extend FortiManager firewall policies to Kubernetes

**Use case**: Control Kubernetes clusters directly and apply policy.

**Problem**: To avoid disruption, teams need to leverage existing FortiManager as the primary user interface.

**Solution**: Use FortiManager to create firewall policies that are applied as {{prodname}} network policies on Kubernetes workloads. Use the power of a {{prodname}} “higher-order tier” so Kubernetes policy is evaluated early in the policy processing order, but update policy using FortiManager UI. Use the {{prodname}} Manager UI as a secondary interface to verify the integration and troubleshoot using logs.
