# Manage clusters

## Connect new clusters

To connect new clusters to {{prodname}}, select Managed Clusters in the left nav, and click **Connect Cluster**.

## Remove a cluster from the managed clusters list

### Prerequisites

- Only users with either the `Owner` or `Admin` [roles](../users/user-management.mdx) are permitted to delete managed clusters.
- The managed cluster must not be connected. For help with disconnecting your managed cluster, see [how to uninstall {{prodname}}](disconnect.mdx).

### Remove a cluster

1. In Manager UI, go to **Managed Clusters**.
1. For the cluster you want to remove, select **Actions** > **Delete**, and then confirm your choice by selecting **Delete cluster**.
1. Verify details on the confirmation modal and click on **Delete** to confirm the managed cluster deletion.

:::note

Deleting a managed cluster does not remove {{prodname}} logs.

If a new managed cluster is connected with the same name as a previously deleted managed cluster, the logs associated with the deleted managed cluster will be displayed as if they belong to the new managed cluster.

### Recover a deleted managed cluster

If you inadvertently delete a managed cluster, select **Actions** > **Reinstall** to restore it. For help with reinstalling a managed cluster see [Upgrade {{prodname}}](../get-started/upgrade-cluster).

## Manage and monitor multiple clusters in Manager UI

### Access your managed clusters

Each time you install {{prodname}} on a cluster, the cluster is added to the drop-down menu in Manager UI.

Use this menu to move between your clusters. You can connect as many managed clusters as your subscriptions allows.

### Managed cluster views

When you select a different cluster from the cluster menu, the entire Manager UI view changes to reflect the selected cluster.
For example, each managed cluster has unique indexes for Elasticsearch clusters, a separate instance of Kibana, and the dashboard reflects only the selected managed cluster.

### Manage policies in multiple clusters

To implement, modify, or view network policies in a given cluster:

1. Toggle to a managed cluster using the managed cluster drop-down menu.
1. Define, modify or view network policies in that cluster.
1. You can monitor the impact of a policy using the policy visualization tool (Flow Viz).

To apply policies in one managed cluster to a different cluster, manually apply the manifest/.yaml using `kubectl`.

To download manifests for a policy, click **Export** for the selected policy.
