# Calico Cloud usage and billing

To determine your monthly usage, we calculate the vCPU usage time in hours for your connected clusters.

## Metering unit and standard pricing

Usage is calculated monthly as a number of *vCPU hours*.
This includes the total vCPU hours for all your connected clusters.

The standard pricing is US$0.025 per vCPU hour.

There is no additional cost for log data ingestion.
