If multiple match, priority is given to NetworkSets in the workload’s own namespace, then to GlobalNetworkSets, and then to NetworkSets in other namespaces. For ties between matching network sets within each category, CIDR matches outrank domain matches and longest-prefix wins between competing CIDR matches.

| `dest_domains`                    | array of keywords | Find all the destination domain names for use in a DNS policy by examining `dest_domains`. The field displays information on the top-level domains linked to the destination IP. Applies to flows reported from the source to destinations outside the cluster. If `flowLogsDestDomainsByClient` is disabled, having `dest_domains`: ["A"] doesn't guarantee that the flow corresponds to a connection with domain name A. The destination IP may also be linked to other domain names not yet captured by Calico. |

### Format of the policies field

The `policies` field contains four sub-fields, `all_policies`, `enforced_policies`, `pending_policies`, and `transit_policies`.

| Name                              | Datatype          | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `all_policies`                    | array of keywords | **Deprecated.** This field is a legacy field calculated at flow start time that combines both enforced and staged policies. Because it mixes actual verdicts with simulated ones, it can be misleading and is planned for removal. <br/><br/>**Note:** This field may still appear in logs from older clusters reporting to a newer management cluster. |
| `enforced_policies`               | array of keywords | The policies that were actually enforced on the flow. This list is determined by the dataplane when the flow starts and remains fixed for the flow's lifetime. It represents the concrete actions taken on the traffic. |
| `pending_policies`                | array of keywords | A simulation of what policy evaluation would look like at the time of log generation. It represents a hypothetical restart of the flow where all staged policies are considered active. This field captures types of updates such as: (1) changes to active policies made after the flow started (for example, if a new policy is added that would deny the flow if it restarted), (2) staged policies treated as if they were enforced, and (3) domain-based policies evaluated based on the DNS state at the time of log generation. |
| `transit_policies`                | array of keywords | Policies applied to traffic transiting through the node (for example, policies applied to host endpoints with `applyOnForward: true`) or during pre-DNAT processing. This field functions like `enforced_policies` but specifically for traffic being evaluated at the host endpoint.<br/><br/>**Note**: This field is only populated when `flowLogsPolicyScope` is set to `AllPolicies` in the `FelixConfiguration`. |

Each entry in the list has the following format:

```
<index>|<tier name>|<policy name>|<action>|<rule index>
```

Where,

* `<index>` numbers the order in which the rules were hit, starting with `0`.
  :::tip
  Sort the entries of the list by the `<index>` to see the order that rules were hit.  The entries are displayed in
  random order due to the way they are stored in the datastore.
  :::

* `<tier name>` is the name of the policy tier containing the policy, or `__PROFILE__` for a rule derived from a
  `Profile` resource (this is the internal datatype used to represent a Kubernetes namespace and its associated
  "default allow" rule).
* `<policy name>` is the name of the policy/profile; its format depends on the type of policy:

  * `<tier>.<name>` for $[prodname] `GlobalNetworkPolicy`.
  * `<namespace>/knp.default.<name>` for Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`.
  * `<namespace>/<tier>.<name>` for $[prodname] `NetworkPolicy`.

  Staged policy names are prefixed with "staged:".

* `<action>` is the action performed by the rule; one of `allow`, `deny`, `pass`.
* `<rule index>` if non-negative, is the index of the rule that was matched within the policy, starting with 0.
  Otherwise, a special value:

  * `-1` means the reporting endpoint was selected by the policy but no rule matched.  The traffic hit the default
    action for the tier.  In this case, the `<policy name>` is selected arbitrarily from the set of policies within
    the tier that apply to the endpoint.
  * `-2` means "unknown". The rule index was not recorded.

### Flow log example, with `no aggregation`

A flow log with aggregation level 0, `no aggregation`, might look like:

The log shows an incoming connection reported by the destination node, allowed by a policy on port 80. The **`start_time`** and **`end_time`** 
describe the aggregation period (5 min.) During this interval, one flow (**`"num_flow": 1`**) was recorded. At higher aggregation levels, flows from 
endpoints performing the same operation and originating from the same Deployment/ReplicaSet are grouped into a single log. In this example, the 
common source endpoints that are prefixed with **`access-6b687c8dcb-`**. Parameters like **`source_ip`** may be dropped and set to **`null`**, depending on 
the aggregation level. As aggregation levels increase, more flows will be grouped together based on your data. For more details on aggregation 
levels, see [configure flow log aggregation](./aggregation.mdx).
