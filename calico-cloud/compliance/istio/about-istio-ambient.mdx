# Istio Ambient Mode

You can use $[prodname] to deploy and manage an Istio service mesh on your cluster.
$[prodname] installs Istio in ambient mode, which conserves resources while providing the same robust mTLS encryption for your workloads.

:::note

Istio Ambient Mode is a tech preview feature.
Tech preview features are subject to significant changes before they become GA.

## About Istio Ambient Mode

Istio is a service mesh that manages and secures communication between microservices.
Typically, Istio uses sidecar proxies that are deployed alongside every pod in the service mesh.
At scale, running these sidecar proxies can be difficult to manage and a drain on resources.

Istio Ambient Mode is a simplified service mesh architecture that removes the need for a sidecar proxy next to every pod.
Instead, it uses node-level components for shared security and a layered approach for advanced traffic management.
This design saves on computing resources and simplifies operations.

## About Istio Ambient Mode on Calico

$[prodname] provides a bundled version of Istio that can be installed and managed by the Tigera Operator.

This integration automates the lifecycle of the Istio components to reduce manual configuration overhead.
CVEs are addressed as part of the regular $[prodname] patch release cadence.
Administrators provision the Istio service mesh by defining a standard `Istio` custom resource.

### The enhanced zTunnel proxy

The zTunnel component in Istio Ambient Mode is a lightweight proxy that runs on every node.

Its main job is to handle encryption, authentication, and policy enforcement for traffic at Layer 4.

A challenge in the original Istio Ambient Mode is that when traffic is routed through the zTunnel, it gets placed into a tunnel on a specific port (15008).
This change makes it impossible for existing Layer 3 or Layer 4 network policies (like those from Calico) to see the original destination port of the traffic.

Calico addresses this by using an enhanced zTunnel that is modified to preserve the original destination port.
This modification allows existing Calico and Kubernetes network policies to continue functioning exactly as they did before, without needing any rewrites, even though the traffic is now encrypted with mTLS.

These zTunnel enhancements are not compatible with Istio's application-layer Waypoint proxy.
If you deploy Waypoint, the reported destination ports will follow the original behavior.
Existing network policies need to be adapted to allow communication to port 15008.
