# Configure an outbound HTTP proxy

$[prodname] supports the use of HTTP proxies for connections that leave the cluster and originate from $[prodname] containers.

`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables can be set on $[prodname] containers by using a mutating admission webhook, or by configuration through the Installation CR if preferred. In the latter case, the Tigera operator will be responsible for setting proxy environment variables on $[prodname] containers that egress out of the cluster.

With either environment variable configuration method, the Tigera operator will detect the proxy environment variables that are set on $[prodname] containers that egress out of the cluster and ensure that network policy in the allow-tigera tier allows these connections.

This page will outline how to configure an HTTP proxy using the Installation CR.

:::caution

$[prodname] assumes that you have exempted in-cluster destinations (including the Kubernetes API server) from proxying via the `NO_PROXY` variable.

## Configuration via Helm
If you wish to manually configure $[prodname] via Helm to set proxy environment variables on $[prodname] containers (rather than using a mutating admission webhook), you will first need to familiarize yourself with how to [customize the $[prodname] Helm chart using values.yaml](../get-started/install-automated#prepare-your-valuesyaml-with-customizations).

Following the instructions linked above, retrieve your `<custom-values>.yaml`. Edit the file to set the `installer.components.installation.proxy` path, which configures the Installation CR with your proxy. This instructs the Tigera operator to program your proxy on relevant containers that it deploys. e.g.:

```yaml
installer:
  components:
    installation:
      proxy:
        httpProxy:  <HTTP proxy value>
        httpsProxy: <HTTPS proxy value>
        noProxy:    <No proxy value>
```

In your `<custom-values>.yaml` file, you'll also need to set the `installer.components.ccInstaller.operatorDeployment.spec.template.spec.containers` path, which programs your proxy on the calico-cloud-controller-manager pod.

```yaml
installer:
  components:
    ccInstaller:
      operatorDeployment:
        spec:
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
                - name: calico-cloud
                  env:
                    - name: HTTP_PROXY
                      value: <HTTP proxy value>
                    - name: HTTPS_PROXY
                      value: <HTTPS proxy value>
                    - name: NO_PROXY
                      value: <No proxy value>

```

Once you've completed your edits to your `<custom-values>.yaml`, you can [install](../get-started/install-automated#install-calico-cloud-as-part-of-an-automated-workflow-1) $[prodname] using your customized values.

:::caution

Ensure that the other required values for the Helm chart are set in the values.yaml file, as indicated by the generated helm install command.

## Configuration via Manifest
If you wish to manually configure $[prodname] via manifests to set proxy environment variables on $[prodname] containers (rather than using a mutating admission webhook), you’ll need to edit the manifests generated at install and reinstall time.

First, you’ll need to edit the cc-operator deploy.yaml so that the `calico-cloud/calico-cloud-controller-manager` Deployment resource has your required environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`) set in its `env` section.

Second, you’ll need to edit the managed-cluster deploy.yaml so that the `calico-cloud/default` Installer resource has the Installation CR proxy configuration set. This is set at the `.spec.components.installation.proxy` path, e.g.

```
apiVersion: operator.calicocloud.io/v1
kind: Installer
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: calico-cloud
spec:
  clusterName: "proxy-cluster"
  resourceVersion: "20241209202443"
  components:
    installation:
      proxy:
        httpProxy:  <HTTP proxy value>
        httpsProxy: <HTTPS proxy value>
        noProxy:    <No proxy value>
```

## Validating Configuration
Once your install or reinstall has completed, you can:
* Check the Installation CR to validate that the `.spec.proxy` path has been set as expected
* Check the calico-cloud-controller-manager Deployment to validate that the environment variables have been set on the container as expected

:::caution

You can manually edit the two places above to configure $[prodname] to use a proxy, but keep in mind that the reinstall process (via Helm or manifest) may overwrite your changes if you did not follow the steps in previous sections.
