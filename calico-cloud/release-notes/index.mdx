### 7/27/22

Improvement: Export logs to a SIEM 

To help meet your compliance requirements, we've added documentation to export logs to a SIEM (syslog, Splunk, or Amazon S3). See [Export logs to a SIEM]({{site.baseurl}}/visibility/elastic/archive-storage).

### 7/7/22

#### New feature: Distributed Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Envoy 

![tech-preview]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tech-preview.svg)

{{site.prodname}} now includes the option to enable Web Application Firewall (WAF) rulesets when using Envoy as a daemonset. This enables operators to implement an additional layer of security and threat detection for application layer traffic. See [Workload-based Web Application Firewall (WAF)]({{site.baseurl}}/threat/web-application-firewall).

#### New Feature: Configuration option to use DNS rules with StagedNetworkPolicies

{{site.prodname}} has added a new configuration option in Felix (`DNSPolicyMode`) that lets you audit DNS rules with StagedNetworkPolicies. There is a small performance trade off if you enable this option, so we recommended to disabling it when it’s not required. See [Felix configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/resources/felixconfig#dnspolicymode).

#### Improvement: Additional predefined RBAC options

{{site.prodname}} now supports 3 more pre-defined RBAC controls (devops, security and compliance persona) for role assignment.

#### Improvement: Anomaly detection deployment

![tech-preview]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tech-preview.svg)

{{site.prodname}} has made the configuration and deployment of anomaly detection jobs for threat detection and performance hotpots more granular, allowing you to selectively enable jobs depending on your use case. See [Detect and alert on anomalies]({{site.baseurl}}/threat/security-anomalies).

#### Improvement: Manager UI now displays cluster installation progress and streaming logs

{{ site.prodname }} now displays information about managed cluster install progress right in the UI.

After you run the install command (**Connect Cluster** wizard in Managed Clusters), installation progress is automatically displayed along with logs for the managed cluster.

### 5/10/22

#### New feature: Visibility into usage metrics

{{ site.prodname }} now displays information about cloud usage metrics. This will provide visibility into the node hours and data ingested for consumption-based invoices.

Account owners can click the new "Usage Metrics" button at the bottom of the left navbar to navigate to the new page.

#### Expanded platform support: AKS with managed Calico

Installation works on clusters with Calico deployed by AKS.

### 4/26/22

#### New feature: Malware detection

![tech-preview]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tech-preview.svg)

{{site.prodname}} introduces malware detection in tech preview, which uses eBPF-based monitoring to log observed file hashes of programs running in your {{site.prodname}} Kubernetes clusters. Malware detection identifies malicious files by comparing observed file hashes with our threat intelligence library of known malware, and generates alerts when malware is detected in your cluster. Alerts can be viewed on the Alerts page of Manager UI.

**If you started using {{site.prodname}} before January 24, 2022**, you must upgrade your existing cluster to get malware detection:

1. Navigate to the **Managed Clusters** page.
1. Select the cluster from the list, and click **Reinstall**. 
1. Copy the updated install script command and run it against your cluster.

### 4/20/22

#### Improved installation

We’ve updated the {{site.prodname}} installation process to improve security, reduce dependencies on utilities (such as bash), and allow you to customize the name of your connected clusters.

The {{site.prodname}} installation process will now require running a `kubectl apply` command instead of a bash script. Additionally, the installation script has been moved behind an authenticated endpoint. The updated install script is now available on the **Managed Clusters** page of the {{site.prodname}} UI.

**If you started using {{site.prodname}} before January 24, 2022**, you must upgrade your existing cluster to get these changes:

1. Navigate to the **Managed Clusters** page.
1. Select the cluster from the list, and click **Reinstall**. 
1. Copy the updated install script command and run it against your cluster.


### 4/19/22

#### New feature: Image Assurance 

![tech-preview]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tech-preview.svg)

{{site.prodname}} introduces Image Assurance in tech preview, enabling DevOps and platform teams to scan images in public and private registries, and images that are automatically discovered in connected clusters. Image Assurance provides a runtime view into risk, based on discovered vulnerabilities. It also offers admission controller policies to enforce how vulnerable images are used to create resources within Kubernetes.

To get started see, [Image Assurance]({{site.baseurl}}/image-assurance/scan-image-registries).
