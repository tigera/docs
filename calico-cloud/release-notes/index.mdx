#### Improved installation process 

Weâ€™ve updated the {{site.prodname}} installation process to improve security, reduce dependencies on utilities (such as bash), and allow you to customize the name of your connected clusters.

The {{site.prodname}} installation process will now require running a `kubectl apply` command instead of a bash script. Additionally, the installation script has been moved behind an authenticated endpoint. The updated install script is now available on the **Managed Clusters** page of the {{site.prodname}} UI.

**Customers who started {{site.prodname}} before January 24, 2022**

To take advantage of the above benefits, you must upgrade your existing cluster:

1. Navigate to the **Managed Clusters** page.
1. Select the cluster from the list, and click **Reinstall**. 
1. Copy the updated install script command and run it against your cluster.

#### Image Assurance 

![tech-preview]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tech-preview.svg)

{{site.prodname}} introduces Image Assurance in tech preview, enabling DevOps and platform teams to scan images in public and private registries, and images that are automatically discovered in connected clusters. Image Assurance provides a runtime view into risk, based on discovered vulnerabilities. It also offers admission controller policies to enforce how vulnerable images are used to create resources within Kubernetes.

To get started see, [Image Assurance]({{site.baseurl}}/image-assurance/scan-image-registries).
