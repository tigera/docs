#### New feature: Malware detection

![tech-preview]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tech-preview.svg)

{{site.prodname}} introduces malware detection in tech preview, which uses eBPF-based monitoring to log observed file hashes of programs running in your {{site.prodname}} Kubernetes clusters. Malware detection identifies malicious files by comparing observed file hashes with our threat intelligence library of known malware, and generates alerts when malware is detected in your cluster. Alerts can be viewed on the Alerts page of Manager UI.

**If you started using {{site.prodname}} before January 24, 2022**, you must upgrade your existing cluster to get malware detection:

1. Navigate to the **Managed Clusters** page.
1. Select the cluster from the list, and click **Reinstall**. 
1. Copy the updated install script command and run it against your cluster.

### 4/20/22

#### Improved installation

Weâ€™ve updated the {{site.prodname}} installation process to improve security, reduce dependencies on utilities (such as bash), and allow you to customize the name of your connected clusters.

The {{site.prodname}} installation process will now require running a `kubectl apply` command instead of a bash script. Additionally, the installation script has been moved behind an authenticated endpoint. The updated install script is now available on the **Managed Clusters** page of the {{site.prodname}} UI.

**If you started using {{site.prodname}} before January 24, 2022**, you must upgrade your existing cluster to get these changes:

1. Navigate to the **Managed Clusters** page.
1. Select the cluster from the list, and click **Reinstall**. 
1. Copy the updated install script command and run it against your cluster.


### 4/19/22

#### New feature: Image Assurance 

![tech-preview]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tech-preview.svg)

{{site.prodname}} introduces Image Assurance in tech preview, enabling DevOps and platform teams to scan images in public and private registries, and images that are automatically discovered in connected clusters. Image Assurance provides a runtime view into risk, based on discovered vulnerabilities. It also offers admission controller policies to enforce how vulnerable images are used to create resources within Kubernetes.

To get started see, [Image Assurance]({{site.baseurl}}/image-assurance/scan-image-registries).
