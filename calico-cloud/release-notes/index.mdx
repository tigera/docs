#### Image Assurance 

![tech-preview]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tech-preview.svg)

{{site.prodname}} introduces Image Assurance in tech preview, enabling DevOps and platform teams to scan images in public and private registries, and images that are automatically discovered in connected clusters. Image Assurance provides a runtime view into risk, based on discovered vulnerabilities. It also offers admission controller policies to enforce how vulnerable images are used to create resources within Kubernetes.

To get started see, [Image Assurance]({{site.baseurl}}/image-assurance/scan-image-registries).
