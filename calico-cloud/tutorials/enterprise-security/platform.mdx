In this article you will learn some best practices to secure platform tier applications.

### Isolate platform applications

You may have several types of platform applications in your environment:

- Storage platform
- Secret management
- Container security
- Platform monitoring
- Application performance monitoring

We recommend that you implement all your platform applications controls in a **platform tier**, implicitly allowing granular ingress and egress controls for platform applications pods and denying everything else. This effectively isolates platform applications from business applications, and extends the multi-tenancy and application microsegmentation controls to platform applications.

### Platform order

Unless you are a large enterprise organization with security teams that require that security takes precedence, we recommend that you put the platform tier before the security tier.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: Tier
metadata:
  name: platform
spec:
  order: 200
```

### Map your application access controls to policy

Next, we recommend that you refer to your platform application documentation and get the communication map of application pods, and reflect the controls in your network policy. 

### Create a global network policy 

Here is our global network policy that allows application (`platform-app1`) and service (`platf-app1-svc2`), ingress access to service (`svc = platf-app1-svc1`) from port 12345.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: platform.platform-app2-svc2
spec:
  tier: platform
  selector: (app == "platform-app1" && svc == "platf-app1-svc2")
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: svc == "platf-app1-svc1"
      destination:
        ports:
          - '12345'
  types:
    - Ingress
```
