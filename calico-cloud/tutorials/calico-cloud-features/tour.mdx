### What you will learn

- The basic views in Manager UI, and how each provides visibility into your Kubernetes deployment

### About your managed clusters

After you install {{site.prodname}} on a cluster, the cluster is displayed in the Manager as a **managed cluster**. Click the cluster in the upper right corner for the drop-down menu.

![cluster-menu]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cluster-menu.png)

Each time you change to a different cluster, the entire Manager "view" is set for the cluster you've selected. For example, each managed cluster has unique indexes for Elasticsearch clusters and the dashboard reflects only the selected managed cluster. 

Let's walk through each tab in the left navigation of Manager.

### Dashboard

The dashboard is a birds-eye view of cluster activity for policy and networking. For example, you can monitor connection spikes in traffic that may indicate issues, and see at a glance if any endpoints are without policy. The filter lets you change the time range for the charts. 

![dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/images/dashboard.png)

### Policies

**Network policy** is the primary tool for securing a Kubernetes network. It lets you restrict the network traffic (egress and ingress) in your cluster so only the traffic that you want to flow is allowed. {{site.prodname}} supports managing:

- {{site.prodname}} network policy
- {{site.prodname}} global network policy
- Kubernetes policy 

To provide guardrails for managing network policy in your Kubernetes platform, {{site.prodname}} provides **policy tiers**. Policy tiers allow users with more authority (like devops) to enforce network policies that take precedence over service owners and developers. This is also known as *hierarchical tiers*.

You'll want to use the **policy board** view for moving and ordering tiers. To reorder tiers, just drag and move the tier left or right in the graphical sequence. You can move policies up and down in a tier, or left and right to a different tier.  

![policy-board]({{site.baseurl}}/images/policy-board.png)

You can also export one or all policies in a tier to .yaml format.

![export-yaml]({{site.baseurl}}/images/export-yaml.png)


The **policy board filter** is another powerful tool for understanding traffic flows (like denied traffic) within your cluster. 

![policy-filters]({{site.baseurl}}/images/policy-filters.png)

The **grid view** of policy is good for seeing a list of all policies and for adding policies and tiers. 

![policy-grid]({{site.baseurl}}/images/policy-grid.png)

#### Policy manifest versus GUI editor

Manager uses the familiar .yaml/manifest policy format in features like the **Timeline** for viewing audit logs: 

![timeline]({{site.baseurl}}/images/timeline.png)

For editing {{site.prodname}} policy, the GUI editor is a great tool to design and test/stage policies before you enforce it. 

![edit-policy]({{site.baseurl}}/images/edit-policy.png)

Malformed policy, or policy that doesn't work as intended can be caught using the following policy lifecycle tools. 

#### Recommended policy for new users

After installing {{site.prodname}}, one of the first things you want to do is secure unprotected pods/workloads with network policy. (For example, Kubernetes pods accept traffic from any source by default.) The recommended policy feature lets you generate policies that protect specific endpoints in the cluster. It is useful for new users with minimal experience with network policy.

![recommend-policy]({{site.baseurl}}/images/recommend-policy.png)

#### Stage and preview policies 

![policy-lifecycle]({{site.baseurl}}/images/policy-lifecycle.png)

**Policy stage** is another guardrail that lets you evaluate the effects of a network policy before enforcing it, (for example, a default deny policy). After you verify that a staged network policy is allowing traffic as expected, you can enforce it. 

**Preview** lets you iterate on policies and evaluate changes to see how they may affect existing traffic. 

### Timeline

What changed, who did it, and when? This information is critical for security. Native Kubernetes doesn’t provide an easy way to capture audit logs for pods, namespaces, service accounts, network policies, and endpoints. The {{site.prodname}} timeline provides audit logs for all changes to network policy and other resources associated with your {{site.prodname}} deployment. 

![audit-logs]({{site.baseurl}}/images/audit-logs.png)

### Endpoints

This display lists all of your workload endpoints.

#### Nodes

This displays all nodes associated with your cluster. 

![nodes]({{site.baseurl}}/images/nodes.png)

### Network Sets

Network sets and global network sets are {{site.prodname}} resources for defining IP subnetworks/CIDRs, which can be matched by standard label selectors in Kubernetes or {{site.prodname}} network policy. A simple use case is to limit traffic to/from external networks. For example, create a global network set with "deny-lists CIDR ranges 192.0.2.55/32 and 203.0.113.0/24", and reference the network set in a global network policy.

![network-sets]({{site.baseurl}}/images/network-sets.png)

### Flow Visualizations

Flow Visualizer (also called "FlowViz") is a powerful {{site.prodname}} tool to gain visibility into network traffic within the cluster and troubleshoot issues. The most common use of Flow Visualizer is to find packet allowed/denied flows, and to see how things are changing in your deployment. You can quickly drill down and pinpoint which policies are allowing and denying traffic between their services. 

![flow-viz]({{site.baseurl}}/images/flow-viz.png)

### Service Graph

Service Graph provides a point-to-point, topographical representation of network traffic within your cluster. It enables platform operators and application developers understand networking relationships between namespaces, services, and deployments with a rich set of tools to filter resources and save views. Selecting a node or edge on the graph displays detailed networking and DNS activity on the right-side panel, while automatically filtering raw flow log data that is displayed on the bottom panel.

Layers provide a unique way to manage the scale of the graph, allowing you to group resources depending on their purpose within a cluster (e.g. monitoring, infrastructure, storage, networking) and easily hide and show them as part of a saved view. This enables application developers and platform operators to tailor views based on their use case.

![service-graph]({{site.baseurl}}/images/service-graph.png)

**Nodes**  

Right-click any node on the graph, hide the node or hide unrelated (to hide anything that isn’t communicating with the selected node).

**Edges**  

Select any of the edges on the graph and see details on ports/protocols on the right; the raw flow logs are automatically filtered in the bottom panel.

![service-graph-details]({{site.baseurl}}/images/service-graph-details.png)

**Layers**   

Create meaningful groupings of resources for different types of platform infrastructure in your cluster - networking, storage, logging et al.

- See Tigera Components Layer, which contains a number of namespaces related to networking
- If you hide this layer, only the business application namespaces remain in the graph

![service-graph-layers]({{site.baseurl}}/images/service-graph-layers.png)

**Namespaces**  

Double-click on any namespace for a detailed view of all the service-to-service communications in that namespace. 

![service-graph-namespace]({{site.baseurl}}/images/service-graph-namespace.png)   

**DNS Logs**  

These are the foundation of security and observability in {{site.prodname}}. A quick look shows the rich Kubernetes context to help troubleshoot issues. Here are filtered logs for DNS stats.

![service-graph-flows]({{site.baseurl}}/images/service-graph-flows.png) 

### Compliance Reports

Existing compliance tools that rely on periodic snapshots, do not provide accurate assessments of Kubernetes workloads
against your compliance standards. {{site.prodname}} compliance dashboard and reports provide a complete inventory of regulated workloads, along with evidence of enforcement of network controls for these workloads. Additionally, audit reports are available to see changes to any network security controls. 

Compliance report are based on archived flow logs and audit logs for all of your {{site.prodname}} resources, plus any audit logs you’ve configured for Kubernetes resources in the Kubernetes API server:

- Pods
- Service accounts
- Namespaces
- Kubernetes service endpoints
- Global network sets
- Calico and Kubernetes network policies
- Global network policies
- Compliance reports provide the following high-level information:

**Protection**
- Endpoints explicitly protected using ingress or egress policy
- Endpoints with Envoy enabled

**Policies and services**
- Policies and services associated with endpoints
- Policy audit logs

**Traffic**
- Allowed ingress/egress traffic to/from namespaces
- Allowed ingress/egress traffic to/from the internet

![compliance-reporting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/compliance-reporting.png)

### Alerts

How do you know if you have an infected workload? {{site.prodname}} detects and alerts on unexpected network behavior that may indicate a security breach. You can create alerts for:

- Known attacks and exploits (for example, exploits found at Shopify, Tesla, Atlassian)
- DOS attempts
- Attempted connections to botnets and command and control servers
- Abnormal flow volumes or flow patterns using machine learning

### Kibana

{{site.prodname}} includes a fully-integrated deployment of Elasticsearch to collect flow
log data that drives key features like the Flow Visualizer, metrics in the dashboard and Policy Board, policy automation and testing features, and security. 

{{site.prodname}} also embeds Kibana to view raw log data for the traffic within your cluster. Kibana provides its own set of powerful filtering capabilities to quickly drill into log data. For example, use filters to drill into flow log data for specific namespaces and pods. Or view details and metadata for a single flow log entry.
