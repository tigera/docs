A global network policy resource (`GlobalNetworkPolicy`) represents an ordered set of rules which are applied
to a collection of endpoints that match a [label selector](#selector).

`GlobalNetworkPolicy` is not a namespaced resource. `GlobalNetworkPolicy` applies to [workload endpoint resources](workloadendpoint.mdx) in all namespaces, and to [host endpoint resources](hostendpoint.mdx).
Select a namespace in a `GlobalNetworkPolicy` in the standard selector by using
`projectcalico.org/namespace` as the label name and a `namespace` name as the
value to compare against, e.g., `projectcalico.org/namespace == "default"`.
See [network policy resource](networkpolicy.mdx) for namespaced network policy.

`GlobalNetworkPolicy` resources can be used to define network connectivity rules between groups of {{prodname}} endpoints and host endpoints.
<!--TODO-XREF-CC
and take precedence over [Profile resources](/reference/resources/profile) if any are defined.
-->

GlobalNetworkPolicies are organized into [tiers](tier.mdx), which provide an additional layer of orderingâ€”in particular, note that the `Pass` action skips to the
next [tier](tier.mdx), to enable hierarchical security policy.

For `kubectl` [commands](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/), the following case-insensitive aliases
may be used to specify the resource type on the CLI:
`globalnetworkpolicy.projectcalico.org`, `globalnetworkpolicies.projectcalico.org` and abbreviations such as
`globalnetworkpolicy.p` and `globalnetworkpolicies.p`.

## Sample YAML

This sample policy allows TCP traffic from `frontend` endpoints to port 6379 on
`database` endpoints.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: internal-access.allow-tcp-6379
spec:
  tier: internal-access
  selector: role == 'database'
  types:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      metadata:
        annotations:
          from: frontend
          to: database
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: role == 'frontend'
      destination:
        ports:
          - 6379
  egress:
    - action: Allow
```

| serviceAccountSelector | Selects the service account(s) to which this policy applies. Select all service accounts in the cluster with a specific name using the `projectcalico.org/name` label.                                                               |                     | [selector](#selector) | all()                                         |

| applyOnForward\*\*     | Indicates to apply the rules in this policy on forwarded traffic as well as to locally terminated traffic.                                                                                                                           | true, false         | boolean               | false                                         |

\* If `types` has no value, {{prodname}} defaults as follows.

> | Ingress Rules Present | Egress Rules Present | `Types` value     |
> | --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
> | No                    | No                   | `Ingress`         |
> | Yes                   | No                   | `Ingress`         |
> | No                    | Yes                  | `Egress`          |
> | Yes                   | Yes                  | `Ingress, Egress` |

\*\* The `doNotTrack` and `preDNAT` and `applyOnForward` fields are meaningful
only when applying policy to a [host endpoint](hostendpoint.mdx).

Only one of `doNotTrack` and `preDNAT` may be set to `true` (in a given policy). If they are both `false`, or when applying the policy to a
[workload endpoint](workloadendpoint.mdx),
the policy is enforced after connection tracking and any DNAT.

`applyOnForward` must be set to `true` if either `doNotTrack` or `preDNAT` is
`true` because for a given policy, any untracked rules or rules before DNAT will
in practice apply to forwarded traffic.
