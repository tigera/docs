While resources may be supplied in YAML or JSON format, this guide provides examples in YAML.

## Overview of resource structure

The general structure of a single resource is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: <type of resource>
metadata:
  # Identifying information
  name: <name of resource>
  ...
spec:
  # Specification of the resource
  ...
```

### Schema

| Field      | Description                                                                             | Accepted Values      | Schema |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| apiVersion | Indicates the version of the API that the data corresponds to.                          | projectcalico.org/v3 | string |
| kind       | Specifies the type of resource described by the YAML document.                          |                      | kind   |
| metadata   | Contains information used to uniquely identify the particular instance of the resource. |                      | map    |
| spec       | Contains the resource specification.                                                    |                      | map    |

### Resource name requirements

Every resource must have the `name` field specified. Name must be unique within a namespace.
Name required when creating resources, and cannot be updated.
A valid resource name can have alphanumeric characters with optional `.`, `_`, or `-`. of up to 128 characters total.

### Multiple resources in a single file
