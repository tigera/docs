description: Methods to ensure that traffic between containers on different hosts is not dropped by GCE fabric.

# Google Compute Engine

To deploy {{prodname}} in [Google Compute Engine (GCE)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/), you must ensure that traffic between containers on different hosts is not dropped by the GCE fabric.
There are a few different options for doing this depending on your
deployment.

## IP-in-IP encapsulation

Container traffic routing can be enabled by setting [IP-in-IP encapsulation](../../networking/configuring/vxlan-ipip.mdx) and NAT outgoing on the configured {{prodname}} IP pools.

See the [IP pool configuration reference](../resources/ippool.mdx) for information on how to configure {{prodname}} IP pools.

## GCE cloud routes

Traffic routing in GCE can be achieved by utilizing GCE cloud routes and running {{prodname}} in policy-only mode.
Kubernetes GCE cloud provider integration simplifies route configuration by enabling Kubernetes to handle creating routes.

## Enabling workload-to-WAN traffic

To allow {{prodname}} networked containers to reach resources outside of GCE, you must configure outgoing NAT on your [{{prodname}} IP pool](../resources/ippool.mdx).
