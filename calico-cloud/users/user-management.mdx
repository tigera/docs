### Authentication

{{ site.prodname }} supports Google Social login and username / password for user authentication.

### Authorization: cluster roles and permissions

In Kubernetes, cluster roles specify cluster permissions and are bound to users using cluster role bindings. We provide the following predefined roles.

**Admin**

- Full access to {{site.prodname}} Manager
- Create and modify {{site.prodname}} resources
- Superuser access for Kibana, including Elasticsearch user

**Viewer**

- Basic user with access to {{site.prodname}} Manager and Kibana:
  - List/view {{site.prodname}} policy, Kubernetes policy, and tier resources
  - List/view logs in Kibana

### Add your own IdP

{{site.prodname}} supports the following IdPs:

- OIDC-based Auth providers (for example Google, Azure AD)

To add an IdP, open a {% include open-new-window.html text='Support ticket' url='https://support.tigera.io/' %}.

#### Azure AD Requirements

To add Azure AD as your IdP, create an Active Directory "App Registration" with a Redirect URI of type "Web" set to https://auth.calicocloud.io/login/callback.

Enable "ID Token" for implicit flows.

Add the following Microsoft Graph API delegated permissions:

- Directory.Read.All
- User.Read
- OpenId permissions:
  - email
  - openid
  - profile
