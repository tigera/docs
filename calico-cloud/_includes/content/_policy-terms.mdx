If you are new to Kubernetes and open-source Calico, here are key concepts that are essential to understand for building Calico network policies for your Kubernetes cluster.

| Term                             | Definition                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Kubernetes policy                | The native Kubernetes policy construct for enforing security controls at the pod level. Calico Cloud lets you manage your Kubernetes policies, but also create and manage Calico Cloud policies, which provide a richer set of security controls for pods, but also VMs, and host interfaces. |
| Network policy                   | A Calico Cloud construct for enforcing security controls at the pod level. <br />**Scope**: Namespaces where you apply the policy. |
| Global network policy            | A Calico Cloud construct for enforcing security controls at the pod level. <br />**Scope**: Namespaces where you apply the policy. |
| Label                            | Key value pair assigned to Calico Cloud/Kubernetes objects that provide meaningful information for identification. For example, “Application: App1” identifies the **Application App1**. |
| Selector                         | Used to match labels in your Kubernetes cluster and select endpoints with these labels. |
| Network set                      | A Calico Cloud object to define endpoints that are external to the Kubernetes cluster, and assign labels to them for reference in the Kubernetes cluster. <br />**Scope**: Namespace where you apply the network set. |
| Global  network set              | A Calico Cloud object to define endpoints external to the Kubernetes cluster, and assign label to them for reference in the Kubernetes cluster. <br />**Scope**: Cluster-wide. |
| Ingress                          | Security controls that you apply to network traffic flows *destined to* selected endpoints. |
| Egress                           | Security controls that you apply to network traffic flows *originating from* selected endpoints |
| Tiers                            | A Calico Cloud policy hierarchy consisting of multiple policy tiers for scalability and simplification of policy development, and management by different entities in your organization. Common Calico Cloud tier design includes: Security, Platform, Application, default |
| Allow/Deny/Pass                  | Actions that you can apply to pods in Calico Cloud network policy or global network policy. Pass delegates controls to the next policy Tier and continuing processing. |
| RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) | How you authenticate and authorize access and limit actions on Kubernetes resources and Calico Cloud resources. <br />**Scope**: Namespace (using role and role-binding), or cluster (using cluster-role and cluster-role-binding) |
