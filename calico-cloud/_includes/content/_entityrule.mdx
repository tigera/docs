Entity rules specify the attributes of the source or destination of a packet that must match for the rule as a whole
to match. Packets can be matched on combinations of:

- Identity of the source/destination, by using [Selectors](#selectors) or by specifying a particular
  Kubernetes `Service`. Selectors can match [workload endpoints](../../reference/resources/workloadendpoint.mdx),
  [host endpoints](../../reference/resources/hostendpoint.mdx) and ([namespaced](../../reference/resources/networkset.mdx) or
  [global](../../reference/resources/globalnetworkset.mdx)) network sets.
- Source/destination IP address, protocol and port.

If the rule contains multiple match criteria (for example, an IP and a port) then all match criteria must match
for the rule as a whole to match a packet.

#### Selector performance in EntityRules

When rendering policy into the dataplane, {variables.prodname} must identify the endpoints that match the selectors
in all active rules.  This calculation is optimized for certain common selector types.
Using the optimized selector types reduces CPU usage (and policy rendering time) by orders of magnitude.
This becomes important at high scale (hundreds of active rules, hundreds of thousands of endpoints).

The optimized operators are as follows:

- `label == "value"`
- `label in { 'v1', 'v2' }`
- `has(label)`
- `<expression 1> && <expression 2>` is optimized if **either** `<expression 1>` or `<expression 2>` is
  optimized.

The following perform like `has(label)`.  All endpoints with the label will be scanned to find matches:

- `label contains 's'`
- `label starts with 's'`
- `label ends with 's'`

The other operators, and in particular, `all()`, `!`, `||` and `!=` are not optimized.

Examples:

- `a == 'b'` - optimized
- `a == 'b' && has(c)` - optimized
- `a == 'b' || has(c)` - **not** optimized due to use of `||`
- `c != 'd'` - **not** optimized due to use of `!=`
- `!has(a)` - **not** optimized due to use of `!`
- `a == 'b' && c != 'd'` - optimized, `a =='b'` is optimized so `a == 'b' && <anything>` is optimized.
- `c != 'd' && a == 'b'` - optimized, `a =='b'` is optimized so `<anything> && a == 'b'` is optimized.

### Exact and wildcard domain names

The `domains` field is only valid for egress Allow rules. It restricts the
rule to apply only to traffic to one of the specified domains. If this field is specified, the
parent [Rule](#rule)'s `action` must be `Allow`, and `nets` and `selector` must both be left empty.

<DomainNames />

:::note

{variables.prodname} implements policy for domain names by learning the
corresponding IPs from DNS, then programming rules to allow those IPs. This means that
if multiple domain names A, B and C all map to the same IP, and there is domain-based
policy to allow A, traffic to B and C will be allowed as well.
