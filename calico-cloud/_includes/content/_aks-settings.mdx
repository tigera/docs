1. Run the following command on your AKS cluster to verify it is using the Azure CNI, with network policy disabled. 

    ```bash
    az aks show --query 'networkProfile'
    ```

    You should see `"networkPlugin": "azure"` and `"networkPolicy": null`.

1. Verify that transparent mode is being used by running one of the following commands. 

    `cat /etc/cni/net.d/*` 

    Output should contain: `"mode": "transparent"`. (There are other ways to run `cat /etc/cni/net.d/*`; just ensure that you run the command on one of the nodes in the cluster.)

    OR

    ```bash
    az vmss run-command invoke -g <resource-group> -n <vmss-name> --scripts "cat /etc/cni/net.d/*" --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --query 'value[0].message'
    ```
