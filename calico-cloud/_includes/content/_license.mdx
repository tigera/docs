**What happens when a license expires or is invalid?**  
 Users can log in to Manager UI with read/access for all previously-created resources, but they cannot create any new $[prodname] resources. the web console may appear to function, but actions will not be applied; so it is important to proactively managed your license.

**What happens if I add nodes beyond what I'm licensed for?**

- Node limits are not currently enforced
- All $[prodname] features still work

**How do I get information about my license? Monitor the expiration date?**

- [Prometheus!](../../operations/monitor/metrics/license-agent.mdx). Monitor days till expiration, nodes available, and nodes used.
- Use `kubectl` to get [license key information](../../reference/resources/licensekey.mdx#viewing-information-about-your-license-key)
