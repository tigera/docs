**Node requirements**

A node installed with open-source Calico 3.0 or later, with a minimum of:

  - XX cores
  - XX RAM 
  - XX GB free disk space

**If Calico is not installed on your cluster...**

The quickest way to install open-source Calico on your cluster is the {% include open-new-window.html text='Quickstart install' url='https://docs.projectcalico.org/archive/v3.17/getting-started/kubernetes/quickstart' %}. Follow the instructions in that guide, but use the above node requirements as the minimum. 

**Cluster requirements**

{{site.prodname}} supports all of the open-source {% include open-new-window.html text='Kubernetes deployments' url='https://docs.projectcalico.org/archive/v3.17/getting-started/kubernetes/' %}, except: 

- Docker
- IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)
- K3s

When you install {{site.prodname}}, the script checks that your cluster meets required versions.
