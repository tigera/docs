Connecting a Kubernetes cluster to {{site.prodname}} requires the following:

At least one node installed with open-source Calico 3.0 or later, and these recommendations:

  - 2-4 vCPUs
  - 2-4GB RAM 
  - X8-10GB disk (equivalent to t2/e2 small/medium on AWS/GCP)

**If Calico is not installed on your cluster...**

The quickest way to install open-source Calico on your cluster is the {% include open-new-window.html text='Quickstart install' url='https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/kubernetes/quickstart' %}. Follow the instructions in that guide, but use the above node recommendations. 

**Cluster support**

{{site.prodname}} supports all of the open-source {% include open-new-window.html text='Kubernetes deployments' url='https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/kubernetes/' %}, except: 

- Docker
- IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)
- K3s
