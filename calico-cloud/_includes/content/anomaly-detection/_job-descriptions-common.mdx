### DNS latency

ID: `dns_latency`. Looks for the clients that have too high latency of the DNS requests. May indicate a denial of service attack. This anomaly could also indicate performance issues, like the slowness of processes or the excessive resource consumption.

Environment variables:

- **AD_DNS_LATENCY_SENSITIVITY**

  Default: 15. Decrease this parameter if you want fewer alerts, increase it for more alerts.

### L7 bytes

ID: `l7_bytes`. Looks for pods that send or receive an excessive number of bytes in the L7 requests. May indicate a denial of service attack or other attacks. This anomaly could also indicate performance issues, like the excessive resource consumption.

Environment variables:

- **AD_L7_BYTES_SENSITIVITY**

  Default: 5. Decrease this parameter if you want fewer alerts; increase it for more alerts.

### L7 latency

ID: `l7_latency`. Looks for the pods that have too high latency of the L7 requests. All HTTP requests measured here. May indicate a denial of service attack or other attacks. This anomaly could also indicate performance issues, like the slowness of processes or the excessive resource consumption.

Environment variables:

- **AD_L7_LATENCY_SENSITIVITY**

  Default: 7. Decrease this parameter if you want fewer alerts; increase it for more alerts.

### Process restarts

ID: `process_restarts`. Looks for pods with excessive number of the process restarts. May indicate problems with the processes, including excessive resource consumption due to attacks, or performance issues like process slowness or excessive resource consumption.

- **AD_PROCESS_RESTARTS_SENSITIVITY**

  Default: 2. Decrease this parameter if you want fewer alerts; increase it for more alerts.

- **AD_PROCESS_RESTARTS_MIN_RESTARTS**

  Default: 4. Increase this parameter if you want fewer alerts; decrease it for more alerts.
