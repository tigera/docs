You can use the command line (`kubectl`) to deploy and view network policies in your managed Kubernetes clusters.

- **View network policies in a managed cluster**
    ```bash
    kubectl get -n <namespace> networkpolicy
    ```

- **View global network policies in a managed cluster**
    ```bash
    kubectl get globalnetworkpolicy
    ```

- **View staged network policies in a managed cluster**
    ```bash
    kubectl get -n <namespace> stagednetworkpolicy
    ```

- **View global staged network policies in a managed cluster**
    ```bash
    kubectl get stagedglobalnetworkpolicy
    ```

- **Apply network policies to a managed cluster**
    ```bash
    kubectl get -n <namespace> networkpolicy
    ```

- **Apply global network policies to a managed cluster**
    ```bash
    kubectl get globalnetworkpolicy
    ```
