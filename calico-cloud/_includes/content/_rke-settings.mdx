1. Verify your RKE version.

    {{site.prodname}} supports:

    - Rancher Kubernetes Engine 1.2.6
    - Rancher 2.5.6 and later

1. Verify that your cluster is configured with the networking plugin field set to:
    - `calico`
    - `canal`
    - `none`, and your cluster is installed with a compatible version of Calico 

    >**Note**: If your cluster is configured with the networking plugin `calico` or `canal` you must edit the configuration and switch it to `none` to ensure future updates do not attempt to manage the networking configuration.
