# Exclude vulnerabilities from image scan results

You can exclude specific vulnerabilities from the image scan results (for example, a false positive).
It can be excluded for an image version, all images in the same repository, or all images in the system.

:::caution
Excluding vulnerabilities from image results can significantly change how Image Assurance determines image health and can create actions you need to take to stabilize your workflow.
- **Maximum CVSS score** - an imageâ€™s maximum CVSS score may be reduced to a lower score. An exception could eliminate the vulnerability with the highest CVSS score for an image.
- **Scan assessment** - the assessment value of Pass/Warn/Fail could change because it is based on the maximum CVSS score. For example, Fail could change to Warn, and Warn could change to Pass.
- **Vulnerability global alerts** - alerts may no longer be triggered. Alerts are triggered based on scan results or maximum CVSS score values of images.
- **Admission controller policies** - pods could be created where they were previously blocked. Admission controller policies are based on vulnerability information (scan result and/or maximum CVSS score).

## Exclude a vulnerability

To create a vulnerability exception:
1. Go to **Image Assurance**, **All Scanned Images**.
2. Select an image from the list.
3. On the panel, open the Package, and click **Actions**, **Add Exception**.
3. Enter the required information and click **Save**. The exception is immediately applied to your scan results.

## Exclude many vulnerabilities

To create many vulnerability exceptions using a CSV file, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Image Assurance**, **All Scanned Images**.
2. Click the **Export** button and select **Export data**.
3. Select **CSV** as the file type and **Export a row for each image and CVE IDs** as the table style.
4. Open the exported CSV file in your preferred editor.
5. Add two columns: **Justification** and **Scope**.

The **Scope** column can have three values:

- **any**: The exception applies to all images.
- **image**: The exception applies to all versions of the image.
- **image_tags**: The exception applies to specific tags of an image.
