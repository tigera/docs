# Exclude vulnerabilities from scan results

This guide shows you how to exclude vulnerabilities from your image scan results.
By excluding vulnerabilities that don't require action, such as false positives, you can reduce the volume of reported vulnerabilities that you need to deal with.
You can set the exclusion for a particular vulnerability to apply to a particular image version, all images in a repository, or all images in the system.

:::caution
Excluding vulnerabilities from image results can significantly change how Image Assurance determines image health.
You may need to take corrective action to stabilize your workflow.
- **Maximum CVSS score:** An image’s maximum CVSS score may be reduced to a lower score.
An exception could eliminate the vulnerability with the highest CVSS score for an image.
- **Scan assessment:** The assessment value (Pass, Warn, or Fail) could change because it is based on the maximum CVSS score.
For example, Fail could change to Warn, and Warn could change to Pass.
- **Vulnerability global alerts:** Alerts may no longer be triggered.
Alerts are triggered based on scan results or maximum CVSS score values of images.
- **Admission controller policies:** Pods could be created where they were previously blocked.
Admission controller policies are based on vulnerability information (scan result or maximum CVSS score).

## Exclude a vulnerability from your scan results

You can exclude a vulnerability from your scan results page.

1. From the web console, go to **Image Assurance > All Scan Results**.
1. Select an image from the list.
1. On the scan results panel that appears, expand a package, and then click **Actions > Add Exception**.
1. On the **Add exception** dialog, select a scope, enter an explanation for why you're creating an exception, and then click **Save**.

## Exclude multiple vulnerabilities at the same time

To exclude large numbers of vulnerabilities, you can organize the required information as a CSV file and import it directly to Calico Cloud.

1. Optional: You can start with a preformatted list of all vulnerabilities in your cluster, and then edit the list to include only those vulnerabilities you want to exclude.
1. From the web console, go to **Image Assurance > All Scan Results**.
1. On the **All Scan Results** page, click the **Export** button, and then click **Export data**.
1. On the **Export** dialog that appears, select the **CSV** data type and the **Export a row for each image and CVE IDs** option for the table style.
Click **Export** to download the CSV file.
1. Edit the CSV file

1. Prepare the CSV file with information about the vulnerabilities you want to exclude.
The file must contain the following information:

| Column header | Description | Example |
   | -- | -- | -- |
| `CVE` | The CVE identifier. Required by the `any`, `repo`, and `image` scopes. | `CVE-2024-1234` |
| `Registry`| The URL path to the container registry. Required by the `repo` and `image` scopes. | `mycontainerregistry.io/my-org` |
| `Repository`| The container image name. Required by the `repo` and `image` scopes.| `my-application` |
| `Tags`| A JSON list of image tags. Required by the `image` scope. | `"[""v1.2.3"",""v2.3.4""]"` |
| `Justification` | Your explanation for why you're excluding this vulnerability. Required by the `any`, `image`, and `image` scopes.| `This one is a false positive.` |
| `Scope` | Determines whether the vulnerability exception applies only to specific tagged images, to any image in a specific repository, or to any image where the vulnerability is found. One of the following values is required:<br/>&bull; `any`: The exception applies to all images.<br/>&bull; `repo`: The exception applies to all versions of an image in a repository.<br/>&bull; `image`: The exception applies to a specific, tagged version of an image. | `image` |

:::tip
An exported vulnerability list (see step 1) includes many more columns than what is required to import vulnerability exceptions in bulk.
You do not need to remove or reorganize the extraneous information, but you do need to add two new columns for `Justification` and `Scope`.

Example: a CSV list of vulnerability exclusion definitions

``` title="example-vulnerability-exclusions.csv"
CVE,Registry,Repository,Tags,Justification,Scope
CVE-2024-1234,mycontainerregistry.io/my-org,my-application,"[""v3.4.5""]",justification,image
CVE-2024-2345,mycontainerregistry.io/my-org,my-application,"[""v1.2.3"",""v2.3.4""]",justification,image
CVE-2024-3456,mycontainerregistry.io/my-org,my-application,,justification,repo
CVE-2024-4567,,,,justification,any
   ```

1. In the web console, go to **Image Assurance > Vulnerability Exceptions**, and then click <UploadIcon width="20" height="20"/>&nbsp;**Upload&nbsp;exceptions**.
1. Select the CSV file you created, and then click **Upload file**.
After the data is validated, you'll see a summary of the exceptions.
If there are errors, modify your CSV file and repeats steps 1 and 2.
1. Review the processed exceptions on the summary page click **Create exceptions**.
The new exceptions are listed on the **Vulnerability Exceptions** page.
