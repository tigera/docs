### Big picture

Protecting your cluster from vulnerable images can be very difficult. An image that appears to be secure today could 
contain a newly-discovered vulnerability tomorrow, and acting on this new information in real time can be challenging.

{{site.prodname}}â€™s Image Assurance Admission Controller automatically blocks resources that would create containers with vulnerable images from entering your cluster using the latest vulnerability data and scan results.

### Concepts

#### About the {{site.prodname}} Admission Controller

{{site.prodname}} uses {% include open-new-window.html text='Kubernetes Validating Webhook Configuration' url='https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/' %} to register the {{site.prodname}} Admission Controller as a callback to accept or reject resources that create pods (such as deployments and daemonsets).

#### How the Admission Controller evaluates admission requests

The {{site.prodname}} Admission Controller blocks the creation or modification of resources that create pods. If a resource that creates pods is admitted by the Admission Controller, *the pods it creates are not reevaluated*. For example, if you create a deployment, the Admission Controller receives an admission request and either allows or rejects the request. If allowed, the Admission Controller will not evaluate the request for the replica set that Kubernetes creates for the deployment or the pod that is created for the replica set. Why? Because it could destabilize a production cluster if new vulnerabilities are found for deployed images and pods are restarted.

However, if you *create a pod directly*, the Admission Controller evaluates the admission request for the pod and allows or rejects the request.

#### About container admission policies

Container admission policies are custom Kubernetes resources that allow you to configure the criteria for the Admission Controller to reject admission requests for resources that create pods.

#### Install the Admission Controller

1. Create a directory to download the manifests/scripts needed for the installation.

   ```bash
   mkdir admission-controller-install && cd admission-controller-install
   ```

1. Generate the certificate key pair.

   For secure TLS communication between the Kubernetes API server and the Admission controller, you must generate a TLS
   certificate and key pair.
   
   You can either generate the TLS key and certificate yourself and move them to the current folder under the names
   `admission_controller_key.pem` and `admission_controller_cert.pem`, or use the following command to generate the pair:
   ```bash
   export URL="{{site.clouddownloadurl}}/manifests" && curl ${URL}/generate-open-ssl-key-cert-pair.sh | bash
   ```

   >**Note**: If you generate the key and certificate pair yourself, you must set the SANS to `tigera-image-assurance-admission-controller-service.tigera-image-assurance.svc`
   {: .alert .alert-info}

1. Download and configure the Admission Controller manifests.
   
   As a safety mechanism, we require that you specify the namespaces that the Admission Controller will apply in
   the `IN_NAMESPACE_SELECT_KEY` and the `IN_NAMESPACE_SELECTOR_VALUES`. These values configure the Kubernetes API server to send admission requests to our Admission Controller only for resources from relevant namespaces.

   For example, to configure the Kubernetes API server to send admission requests for resources created in any namespace with label key `foo`, and label values either `bar` or `baz`, the variables would be set as follows:
   
   ```bash
   export IN_NAMESPACE_SELECTOR_KEY="foo" && IN_NAMESPACE_SELECTOR_VALUES="bar baz"
   ```

   >**WARNING!**: Do not add Kubernetes critical namespaces such as the `kube-system` namespace. This could create a
   deadlock situation where you cannot bring up the Admission Controller because a critical Kubernetes pod is not running, but you also cannot bring up the critical Kubernetes pod because the Admission Controller is not running.
   {: .alert .alert-warning}

   ```bash
   export URL="{{site.clouddownloadurl}}/manifests" && \
   export IN_NAMESPACE_SELECTOR_KEY="name" && \
   export IN_NAMESPACE_SELECTOR_VALUES="default" && \
   curl ${URL}/install-ia-admission-controller.sh | bash
   ```

1. Apply the Admission Controller manifests.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ./*
   ```

### Create container admission policies

Container admission policies are used to define criteria for the Admission Controller to admit or reject admission for resources that create pods. For details, see [ContainerAdmissionPolicies]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/resources/containeradmissionpolicy).

### Sample container admission policies

This ContainerAdmissionPolicy allows admission requests for pod-creating resources whose image is in the registry/repository `gcr.io/company/production-repository/*`, with a scan status of either `Pass` or `Warn`, and rejects all other admission requests.

```yaml
   apiVersion: containersecurity.tigera.io/v1beta1
   kind: ContainerAdmissionPolicy
   metadata:
     name: reject-failed-and-non-gcr
   spec:
     selector: all()
     namespaceSelector: all()
     order: 10
     rules:
     - action: "Reject"
       imagePath:
         operator: IsNoneOf
         values:
         - "^gcr.io/company/production-repository/.*"
     - action: Allow
       imageScanStatus:
         operator: IsOneOf
         values:
         - Pass
         - Warn
     - action: Reject
```

This ContainerAdmissionPolicy rejects deploying or updating pod-creating resources with the label, `reject-policy: reject-outdated-scans`, from any namespace labeled, `apply-container-admission-policies == 'true'`, that would deploy an image that hasn't been scanned in 3 days.

```yaml
   apiVersion: containersecurity.tigera.io/v1beta1
   kind: ContainerAdmissionPolicy
   metadata:
    name: reject-failed-and-non-gcr
   spec:
    selector: "reject-policy == 'reject-outdated-scans'"
    namespaceSelector: "apply-container-policies == 'true'"
    order: 1
    rules:
    - action: Reject
      imageLastScan:
        operator: "gt"
        duration:
          days: 3
```

### Troubleshooting

**My container admission policy is not blocking resources from a namespace, even though the namespaceSelector matches my namespace**

The Kubernetes API server is likely not sending admission requests for the namespace in question. Verify that the key and value(s) you specified for `IN_NAMESPACE_SELECT_KEY` and `IN_NAMESPACE_SELECT_VALUES` in the installation steps, match the policy namespaces.
