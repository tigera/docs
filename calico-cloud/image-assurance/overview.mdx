# Choose an image scanning method

## Big picture

Scan images and Kubernetes workloads for vulnerabilities using {{prodname}} Image Assurance.

## Value

{{prodname}} Image Assurances helps you identify vulnerabilities in container images that you deploy to Kubernetes clusters. Vulnerabilities are known flaws in libraries and packages used by applications that attackers can exploit and cause harm. With Image Assurance you can:

- Scan an image for vulnerabilities
- Assess the impact of newly-found vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts
- Catch vulnerabilities days or weeks later with continuous image rescanning
- Create exceptions to ignore specific vulnerabilities
- Create alerts on high-severity vulnerabilities so you can delegate remediation efforts to the appropriate team
- Block non-compliant workloads using policy as part of your cloud-native security posture

## About Image Assurance

Image Assurance is based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system, which provides a catalog of publicly-known security vulnerabilities and exposures. Known vulnerabilities are identified by a unique CVE ID based on the year it was reported (for example, CVE-2021-44228).

Scanned image content includes:

- Libraries and content (for example, python, ruby gems, jars and go)
- Packages (OS and non-OS)
- Image layer

## Image scanning methods

The Image Assurance scanner can be used to scan images using the following methods with the option to send results to the Manager UI or API.

| **Method**                                               | **What images? Where?**                                      | **Benefit**                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scan all images in a Kubernetes cluster                  | Any running image in the Kubernetes cluster including locally-built first-party images to fix critical bugs. | Provides defense-in-depth coverage and an easy way to get started with vulnerability scanning and remediation. |
| Integrate Image Assurance scanner in your build pipeline | Images in your application build pipeline and private registeries including:   <br />- Customer-built images<br />- Local images<br />- Third-party images from public registries (for example Kafka, reddis) | Incorporate the IA scanner as a lightweight runner in your build pipeline, and use the scanner offline and on-demand for ad hoc scanning and emergency patching. |

## Next steps

- Start image scanning using [CLI scanner](./scanners/pipeline-scanner) or [enable automatic image scanning](./scanners/cluster-scanner) inside a cluster using cluster scanner.
- [Set up alerts on vulnerabilities](./set-up-alerts)
