# Overview

## Big picture

Scan images and Kubernetes workloads for vulnerabilities using {{prodname}} Image Assurance.

## Value

{{prodname}} Image Assurances helps you identify vulnerabilities in workloads that you deploy to Kubernetes clusters. A vulnerability can be a weakness in an application (for example, a design flaw or an implementation bug) that allows attackers to cause additional harm. With Image Assurance you can:

- Scan an image for vulnerabilities
- Assess the impact of newly-found vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts
- Create exceptions to ignore specific vulnerabilities
- Create alerts on high-severity vulnerabilities so you can delegate remediation efforts to the appropriate team
- Block non-compliant workloads using policy as part of your cloud-native security posture

## About Image Assurance

Image Assurance is based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system, which provides a catalog of publicly-known security vulnerabilities and exposures. Known vulnerabilities are identified by a unique CVE ID based on the year it was reported (for example, CVE-2021-44228).

Image Assurance provides a command-line interface (CLI) and cluster scanner to scan images, with the option to send results to the Manager UI. Scanned image content includes:

- Libraries and content (for example, python, ruby gems, jars and go)
- Packages (OS and non-OS)
- Image layer

## Before you begin

**Update your cluster**

Update your cluster to get the latest version of Image Assurance:

1. Navigate to the **Managed Clusters** page.
2. Select the cluster from the list, and click **Reinstall**.
3. Copy the updated installation script command and run it against your cluster.

## Next steps

- Start image scanning using [CLI scanner](./scanners/cli-based-scanner) or [enable automatic image scanning](./scanners/cluster-scanner) inside a cluster using cluster scanner.
