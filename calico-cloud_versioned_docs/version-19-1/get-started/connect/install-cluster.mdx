# Connect a cluster to Calico Cloud

You can connect a cluster to Calico Cloud by generating a unique kubectl command in the Calico Cloud Manager UI and running it on your cluster.

## Prerequisites

* You have an active Calico Cloud account. You can sign up for a 14-day free trial at [calicocloud.io](https://calicocloud.io).
* You are signed in to the Calico Cloud Manager UI as a user with the **Owner**, **Admin**, or **DevOps** role.
* You have at least one cluster that meets our [system requirements](requirements/system-requirements.mdx).
* You have kubectl access to the cluster.

## Connect a cluster to Calico Cloud

1. From the **Managed Clusters** page, click **Connect Cluster**.
1. In the **Connect a Cluster** dialog, enter a **Cluster Name** and select a **Cluster Type**.
1. (Optional) If you must install a specific older release, select the Calico Cloud version you want to install.
   We always recommend the latest version, which is installed by default.
1. Click **Connect** to generate a unique kubectl command. Copy the command.

   ```bash title="Example of generated kubectl installation command"
   kubectl apply -f https://installer.calicocloud.io/manifests/cc-operator/latest/deploy.yaml && curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mprcnz04t:9dav6eoag:s8w7xjslez1x1xkf6ds0h23miz5b1fw6phh9897d0n76e4pjfdekijowjv5lw9dd" "https://www.calicocloud.io/api/managed-cluster/deploy.yaml?version=v19.1.0" | kubectl apply -f -
   ```

1. From a terminal, paste and run the command.
1. On the **Managed Clusters** page, you should immediately see your cluster in the list of managed clusters.
   Monitor the status under **Connection Status**.
   When the status changes to **Connected**, installation is complete and your cluster is connected to Calico CLoud.
