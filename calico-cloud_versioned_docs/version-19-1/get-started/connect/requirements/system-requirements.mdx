# System requirements

### Step 1: Verify cluster

<!--  This file is referenced in the manager UI and its location should not be changed with accounting for references from pendo/manager UI. A symlink so this file exists at install/system-requirements.  -->

Verify that your cluster meets these requirements.

| Required                    | Supported                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Platforms**               | All of the Calico Open Source [Kubernetes deployments](https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/kubernetes/), except: <br/><br/>- OpenShift<br />- IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)<br/>- K3s <br />- Most clusters with Windows nodes. (We support Windows nodes on AKS.)<br />- RKE |
| **Architecture**            | Only AMD64                                                   |
| **Kubernetes version**      | - Minimum: v1.23<br/>- Maximum: v1.28<br /><br />If you have a later version than the maximum, contact [Support](https://support.tigera.io/). |
| **CNIs**                    | - Calico CNI v3.15 to v3.26<br />- Amazon VPC CNI<br/>- Azure CNI<br/>- GKE CNI |
| **Browsers for Manager UI** | {{prodname}} supports the latest version and "latest minus one" versions of the following browsers:<br/><br/>- Chrome<br/>- Firefox<br/>- Safari |


### Step 2: Verify cluster is not managed by a Kubernetes reconciler

{{prodname}} cannot be installed on clusters that are managed by any kind of Kubernetes reconciler (for example, Addon-manager). To verify, look for an annotation called `addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode` on either of the following resources. (The resources may not exist).

- `tigera-operator` deployment in the `tigera-operator` namespace (Installation on AKS may still work if the mode is Reconcile, see [AKS](aks.mdx#verify-addonmanager-is-compatible) for an additional check.)
- `calico-node` daemonset in the `kube-system` namespace

If the following command finds addonmanager on either of the resources, then Addon-manager is being used. Find a different cluster to use.

```bash
kubectl get <type> -n <namespace> <resource-name> -o yaml | grep ' addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode:'
```

### Step 3: Prepare your infrastructure to connect to {{prodname}}

Pods running in your Kubernetes cluster must allow outbound traffic to the following endpoints:

- `https://installer.calicocloud.io:443/*`
- `https://www.calicocloud.io:443/api/*`
- TCP to `<management-cluster>.calicocloud.io:9000`

For each node, Docker must be able to pull images from the following endpoints:

* `quay.io`
* `cdn01.quay.io`
* `cdn02.quay.io`
* `us-docker.pkg.dev`

These connections must be allowed by your Kubernetes cluster and also by the rest of your infrastructure.
You won't be able to use {{prodname}} if other elements of your infrastructure, such as firewalls or security groups, restrict access to these endpoints.

### Step 4: Verify platform-specific requirements

If you using one of the following platforms, review further requirements. Otherwise, you are ready to connect your cluster in Manager UI: go to Managed clusters, and click **Connect**.

- [GKE](gke.mdx)
