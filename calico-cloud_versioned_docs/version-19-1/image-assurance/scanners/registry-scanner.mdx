# Scan images in container registries

Scan images in container registries at any time, on any infrastructure, including Kubernetes.

## Value

Add a layer of defense for images that don’t go through a pipeline (for example, third-party images), but are published to a registry. If CVEs are missed in your build pipeline, you can catch them before they are deployed.

## Concepts

You can run the registry scanner wherever there is a container runtime. And it doesn’t have to be for Kubernetes.

To use registry scanner, all you need to do is:
- Specify the registry paths to the images you want to scan
- Provide permissions for the scanner to access your registries
- Get a token for access to the Image Assurance API

Based on the paths you specify, the scanner recursively scans all images in the registry once, and sends results to the Image Assurance dashboard in Manager UI.

To deploy the registry scanner as a pod in Kubernetes cluster, we recommend that you define a Kubernetes job or cronjob.

## Before you begin

**Required**

- Registry scanner is running where there is a container runtime
- Valid registry credentials

**Supported registry platforms**

- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Google Container Registry (GCR)

**Limitations**

- The registry scanner is available as an image (not using Tigera operator installation)
- You can scan images from only one of the supported registry platforms/account per instance
- If you use the registry scanner with Docker, only tagged images are scanned. However, if you use the scanner with Amazon or Azure, all images (tagged and untagged) are scanned.

## How to

- [Download the registry scanner](#download-the-registry-scanner)
- [Set up authentication to registry scanner](#set-up-authentication-to-registry-scanner)
- [Set up registry scanner](#set-up-registry-scanner)
- [Scan images and send results to Calico Cloud](#scan-images-and-send-results-to-calico-cloud)
- [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot)
- [Get previous registry scanner versions](#get-previous-registry-scanner-versions)

### Download the registry scanner

The registry scanner comes in a Docker image. To get the image, run this command: `docker pull quay.io/tigera/image-assurance-registry-scanner:v1.15.3`.

### Set up authentication to registry scanner

The registry scanner requires authentication to access a registry. Set up credentials for one of the following registry platforms:

- **Docker/Google** - scans only tagged images; untagged images residing in your image registry are not pulled and scanned.
- **Azure or AWS** - scans tagged and untagged images (all)

#### Docker/GCR required credentials

- `DOCKER_USERNAME`
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`

If you have a valid /.docker/config.json, you can also mount this config file on the container while running the registry scanner.

```bash
docker run -e ... -v ~/.docker/config.json:/.docker/config.json quay.io/tigera/image-assurance-registry-scanner:{{imageassuranceversion}}
```
#### Azure required credentials

Registry instances are scanned one at a time. If Docker credentials are found, they are ignored.

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` or `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`

#### AWS required credentials

Registry instances are scanned one at a time. If Docker credentials are found, they are ignored.

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`

### Set up registry scanner

**Required**

- `REGISTRY` - the registry you want to scan. For example, gcr.io.
- `IMAGE_ASSURANCE_API_URL` - Get the URL in the Manager UI
- `IMAGE_ASSURANCE_API_TOKEN` - Get the token in the Manager UI
- Registry credentials: Docker/gcr, acr, or ecr

**Optional**

`REGISTRY_FILTER` - limits scanning time when you have thousands of repositories and images. Supports a comma-separated list.

Example: gcr registry

```bash
gcr.io/prod-env/api
gcr.io/staging-env/api
gcr.io/dev/api
```
To filter out images in the dev "sub" registry:

`-e REGISTRY_FILTER=prod-env,staging-env`

### Scan images and send results to {{prodname}}

Example: gcr registry with Docker credentials

```bash
docker run -e REGISTRY=gcr.io -e IMAGE_ASSURANCE_API_URL=https://<clustId>-management.dev.calicocloud.io/bast
 -e IMAGE_ASSURANCE_API_TOKEN=$TOKEN -e DOCKER_USERNAME=<username> -e DOCKER_PASSWORD=<password>
 quay.io/tigera/image-assurance-registry-scanner:{{imageassuranceversion}}
```

Example: acr registry with Azure credentials

```bash
docker run -e REGISTRY=your-org.azurecr.io -e IMAGE_ASSURANCE_API_URL=https://<clustId>-management.dev.calicocloud.io/bast
 -e IMAGE_ASSURANCE_API_TOKEN=$TOKEN -e AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<azure-client-id> -e AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<azure-client-secret> -e AZURE_TENANT_ID=<azure-tenant-id>
 quay.io/tigera/image-assurance-registry-scanner:{{imageassuranceversion}}
```

Example: ecr registry with AWS credentials

```bash
docker run -e REGISTRY=gcr.io -e IMAGE_ASSURANCE_API_URL=https://<clustId>-management.dev.calicocloud.io/bast
 -e IMAGE_ASSURANCE_API_TOKEN=$TOKEN -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws-access-key> -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-secret-access-key> -e AWS_REGION=<aws-region>
 quay.io/tigera/image-assurance-registry-scanner:{{imageassuranceversion}}
```

Example: run when mounting the dockerfile

```bash
docker run -e REGISTRY=gcr.io -e IMAGE_ASSURANCE_API_URL=https://<clustId>-management.dev.calicocloud.io/bast
 -e IMAGE_ASSURANCE_API_TOKEN=$TOKEN -v ~/.docker/config.json/:/.docker/config.json quay.io/tigera/image-assurance-registry-scanner:{{imageassuranceversion}}
```

### Troubleshoot

**Issues authenticating with registry scanner**

Verify that the registry credentials are correct.

**Scan results are not uploading to {{prodname}}**

Image scan results that are uploaded to {{prodname}} through the registry scanner require additional processing before appearing in the Image Assurance dashboard. This may result in a time delay before CVE results appear for those images in the UI. You can also verify that the API token and URL are correct.

**Scanned images do not match what I expect**

Verify that the credentials on the registry side have the correct permission level.

### Get previous registry scanner versions

For previous versions of registry scanner, see [quay repository](https://quay.io/organization/tigera).
