# Tier

A tier resource (`Tier`) represents an ordered collection of [NetworkPolicies](networkpolicy.mdx)
and/or [GlobalNetworkPolicies](globalnetworkpolicy.mdx).
Tiers are used to divide these policies into groups of different priorities. These policies
are ordered within a Tier: the additional hierarchy of Tiers provides more flexibility
because the `Pass` `action` in a Rule jumps to the next Tier. Some example use cases for this are.

- Allowing privileged users to define security policy that takes precedence over other users.
- Translating hierarchies of physical firewalls directly into $[prodname] policy.

For `kubectl` [commands](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/), the following case-insensitive aliases
may be used to specify the resource type on the CLI:
`tier.projectcalico.org`, `tiers.projectcalico.org` and abbreviations such as
`tier.p` and `tiers.p`.

## How Policy Is Evaluated

When a new connection is processed by $[prodname], each tier that contains a policy that applies to the endpoint processes the packet.
Tiers are sorted by their `order` - smallest number first.

Policies in each Tier are then processed in order.

- If a [NetworkPolicy](networkpolicy.mdx) or [GlobalNetworkPolicy](globalnetworkpolicy.mdx) in the Tier `Allow`s or `Deny`s the packet, then evaluation is done: the packet is handled accordingly.
- If a [NetworkPolicy](networkpolicy.mdx) or [GlobalNetworkPolicy](globalnetworkpolicy.mdx) in the Tier `Pass`es the packet, the next Tier containing a Policy that applies to the endpoint processes the packet.

If the Tier applies to the endpoint, but takes no action on the packet the packet is dropped.

<!--TODO-XREF-CC
If the last Tier applying to the endpoint `Pass`es the packet, that endpoint's [Profiles](/reference/resources/profile) are evaluated.

## Definition

### Metadata

| Field | Description           | Accepted Values | Schema |
| ----- | --------------------- | --------------- | ------ |
| name  | The name of the tier. |                 | string |

### Spec

| Field | Description                                                                                                                          | Accepted Values | Schema | Default               |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------|-----------------------|
| order | (Optional) Indicates priority of this Tier, with lower order taking precedence. No value indicates highest order (lowest precedence) |                 | float  | `nil` (highest order) |

All Policies created by $[prodname] orchestrator integrations are created in the default (last) Tier.
