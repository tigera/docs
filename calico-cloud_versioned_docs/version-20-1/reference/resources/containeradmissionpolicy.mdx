# Container admission policy

A container admission policy (`ContainerAdmissionPolicy`) represents an ordered set of rules which are applied to a
collection of containers that match a [label selector](#selector).

`ContainerAdmissionPolicy` is a cluster resource. `ContainerAdmissionPolicy` can be restricted to a set of namespaces
using a [namespace selector](#selector).

## Sample YAML

This sample policy allows admission requests for pod creating resources whose image is in the registry / repository
`gcr.io/company/production-repository/*` with a scan status of either `Pass` or `Warn`, and rejects all other admission
requests.

```yaml
apiVersion: containersecurity.tigera.io/v1beta1
kind: ContainerAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: reject-failed-and-non-gcr
spec:
  selector: all()
  namespaceSelector: all()
  order: 10
  rules:
  - action: "Reject"
    imagePath:
      operator: IsNoneOf
      values:
      - "^gcr.io/company/production-repository/.*"
  - action: Allow
    imageScanStatus:
      operator: IsOneOf
      values:
      - Pass
      - Warn
  - action: Reject
```

### Selector

A label selector is an expression which either matches or does not match a resource based on its labels.

$[prodname] label selectors support a number of operators, which can be combined into larger expressions
using the boolean operators and parentheses.

| Expression                | Meaning                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Logical operators**     |
| `( <expression> )`        | Matches if and only if `<expression>` matches.  (Parentheses are used for grouping expressions.)
| `! <expression>`          | Matches if and only if `<expression>` does not match.  **Tip:** `!` is a special character at the start of a YAML string, if you need to use `!` at the start of a YAML string, enclose the string in quotes.
| `<expression 1> && <expression 2>` | "And": matches if and only if both `<expression 1>`, and, `<expression 2>` matches
| <code>\<expression 1> &#124;&#124; \<expression 2></code> | "Or": matches if and only if either `<expression 1>`, or, `<expression 2>` matches.
| **Match operators**       |
| `all()`                   | Match all in-scope resources.  To match _no_ resources, combine this operator with `!` to form `!all()`.
| `global()`                | Match all non-namespaced resources.  Useful in a `namespaceSelector` to select global resources such as global network sets.
| `k == 'v'`                | Matches resources with the label 'k' and value 'v'.
| `k != 'v'`                | Matches resources without label 'k' or with label 'k' and value _not_ equal to `v`
| `has(k)`                  | Matches resources with label 'k', independent of value. To match pods that do not have label `k`, combine this operator with `!` to form `!has(k)`
| `k in { 'v1', 'v2' }`     | Matches resources with label 'k' and value in the given set
| `k not in { 'v1', 'v2' }` | Matches resources without label 'k' or with label 'k' and value _not_ in the given set
| `k contains 's'`          | Matches resources with label 'k' and value containing the substring 's'
| `k starts with 's'`       | Matches resources with label 'k' and value starting with the substring 's'
| `k ends with 's'`         | Matches resources with label 'k' and value ending with the substring 's'

Operators have the following precedence:

* **Highest**: all the match operators
* Parentheses `( ... )`
* Negation with `!`
* Conjunction with `&&`
* **Lowest**: Disjunction with `||`

For example, the expression

```
! has(my-label) || my-label starts with 'prod' && role in {'frontend','business'}
```

Would be "bracketed" like this:

```
((!(has(my-label)) || ((my-label starts with 'prod') && (role in {'frontend','business'}))
```

It would match:
* Any resource that did not have label "my-label".
* Any resource that both:
* Has a value for `my-label` that starts with "prod", and,
* Has a role label with value either "frontend", or "business".

Understanding scopes and the `all()` and `global()` operators:  selectors have a scope of resources
that they are matched against, which depends on the context in which they are used.  For example:

* The `nodeSelector` in an `IPPool` selects over `Node` resources.

* The top-level selector in a `NetworkPolicy` selects over the workloads _in the same namespace_ as the
`NetworkPolicy`.

* The top-level selector in a `GlobalNetworkPolicy` doesn't have the same restriction, it selects over all endpoints
including namespaced `WorkloadEndpoint`s and non-namespaced `HostEndpoint`s.

* The `namespaceSelector` in a `NetworkPolicy` (or `GlobalNetworkPolicy`) _rule_ selects over the labels on namespaces
rather than workloads.

* The `namespaceSelector` determines the scope of the accompanying `selector` in the entity rule.  If no `namespaceSelector`
is present then the rule's `selector` matches the default scope for that type of policy.  (This is the same namespace
for `NetworkPolicy` and all endpoints/network sets for `GlobalNetworkPolicy`)

* The `global()` operator can be used (only) in a `namespaceSelector` to change the scope of the main `selector` to
include non-namespaced resources such as [GlobalNetworkSet](globalnetworkset.mdx).
This allows namespaced `NetworkPolicy` resources to refer to global non-namespaced resources, which would otherwise
be impossible.

### StringValueMatch
A string values match does a match or negative match on a target against a set of values.

| Field     | Description                                       | Accepted Values       | Schema            | Default    |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|------------|
| operator  | Match operator to use against the list of values  | `IsOneOf`, `IsNoneOf` | string            |            |
| values    | List of values to match against.                  |                       | list of strings   |            |

### TimeMatch
A time match does a match or negative match against a time or duration.

Duration is the length of time into the past from the current time to match against. As an example,

```yaml
  operator: "gt"
  duration:
    days: 3
```

is false for 4 days prior to the current date time, and true for 2 days prior to current date time.

Time is the absolute time to match a given time against. As an example,

```yaml
  operator: "gt"
  time: "2022-01-02T0:00:00Z"
```

is false for "2022-01-01T0:00:00Z", and true for "2022-01-03T0:00:00Z".

| Field     | Description                                           | Accepted Values       | Schema                                            | Default    |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| operator  | Match operator to use against the duration or time.   | `gt`, `lt`    | string                                            |            |
| duration  | The duration that this operator matches within.       |               | [Duration](#duration)                             |            |
| time      | List of values to match against.                      |               | String of the format "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"  |            |

### Duration

| Field     | Description                                   | Accepted Values   | Schema    | Default    |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| days      | Number of days past from the current time.    |                   | integer   |            |
| months    | Number of months past from the current time.  |                   | integer   |            |
| years     | Number of years past from the current time.   |                   | integer   |            |
