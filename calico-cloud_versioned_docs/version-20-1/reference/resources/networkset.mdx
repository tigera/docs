# Network set

import DomainNames from '@site/calico-cloud_versioned_docs/version-20-1/_includes/content/_domain-names.mdx';

A network set resource (NetworkSet) represents an arbitrary set of IP subnetworks/CIDRs,
allowing it to be matched by $[prodname] policy. Network sets are useful for applying policy to traffic
coming from (or going to) external, non-$[prodname], networks.

`NetworkSet` is a namespaced resource. `NetworkSets` in a specific namespace
only applies to [network policies](networkpolicy.mdx)
in that namespace. Two resources are in the same namespace if the `namespace`
value is set the same on both. (See [GlobalNetworkSet](globalnetworkset.mdx) for non-namespaced network sets.)

The metadata for each network set includes a set of labels. When $[prodname] is calculating the set of
IPs that should match a source/destination selector within a
[network policy](networkpolicy.mdx) rule, it includes
the CIDRs from any network sets that match the selector.

:::note

Since $[prodname] matches packets based on their source/destination IP addresses,
$[prodname] rules may not behave as expected if there is NAT between the $[prodname]-enabled node and the
networks listed in a network set. For example, in Kubernetes, incoming traffic via a service IP is
typically SNATed by the kube-proxy before reaching the destination host so $[prodname]'s workload
policy will see the kube-proxy's host's IP as the source instead of the real source.

## Sample YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkSet
metadata:
  name: external-database
  namespace: staging
  labels:
    role: db
spec:
  nets:
    - 198.51.100.0/28
    - 203.0.113.0/24
  allowedEgressDomains:
    - db.com
    - '*.db.com'
```

| nets                 | The IP networks/CIDRs to include in the set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Valid IPv4 or IPv6 CIDRs, for example "192.0.2.128/25"                     | list   |         |
| allowedEgressDomains | The list of domain names that belong to this set and are honored in egress allow rules only. Domain names specified here only work to allow egress traffic from the cluster to external destinations. They don't work to _deny_ traffic to destinations specified by domain name, or to allow ingress traffic from _sources_ specified by domain name. | List of [exact or wildcard domain names](#exact-and-wildcard-domain-names) | list   |         |
