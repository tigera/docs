# Enable HostEndpoint reporting in flow logs

## Big picture

Enable $[prodname] flow logs to report HostEndpoint information.

## Value

Get visibility into the network activity at the HostEndpoint level using $[prodname] flow logs.

## Before you begin

**Limitations**

- HostEndpoint reporting is only supported on Kubernetes nodes.
- Flow logs on ApplyOnForward policies are currently not supported. As a result, a policy blocking traffic at the host level
from forwarding to a workload endpoint would not result in a flow log from the host endpoint.

## How to

### Enable HostEndpoint reporting

To enable reporting HostEndpoint metadata in flow logs, use the following command:

```
 kubectl patch felixconfiguration default -p '{"spec":{"flowLogsEnableHostEndpoint":true}}'
```
