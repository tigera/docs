# Creating and assigning custom roles

As an administrator, you can create custom, cluster-specific roles that restrict users to particular functions on a cluster.

## Overview

$[prodname] comes with a set of predefined global roles that let you give permissions to users based on what they need to do.
For example, a user with the Security global role has a broader set of permissions than a user with the Viewer global role.
These permissions apply to all clusters.

But in some cases these global roles can be too broad.

By creating and assigning custom roles, you can be much more discriminating about what permissions you give users.
For example, you could create a role that allows the user to modify network policy for a particular tier and namespace and gives view access to all other network policies.
Permissions are assigned on a cluster-by-cluster basis.

## Required permissions for common $[prodname] features

Certain permissions are required for a user to access common $[prodname] features.

| Feature area | Required permissions | Notes |
| --| -- | -- |
| Alerts | &bull; **View** or **Modify Alerts**<br/>and<br/>&bull;**View Event Logs** or **View All Logs** | |
| Compliance reports | &bull; **View Compliance Reports** | |
| Dashboard | &bull; **View All Logs**<br/>and<br/>&bull; **View Global Network Sets** or **View Network Sets**<br/>and (optional)<br/>&bull; **View Compliance Reports** | These permissions are required for the dashboard to fully populate. All users are granted limited dashboard metrics by having access to a cluster. |
| Network policies | &bull; **View** or **Modify Policies**<br/>or<br/>&bull; **View** or **Modify Global Policies**<br/>and (optional)<br/>&bull; **View Audit Logs** or **View All Logs** | The **Policies** permissions apply to one or more namespaces. The **Global Policies** permissions apply to the whole cluster. These permissions are also scoped by [policy tier](../network-policy/policy-tiers/tiered-policy.mdx). <br/> <br/>The optional **View Audit Logs** or **View All Logs** let users view the change history on the policies. |
| Service graph | &bull; **View All Logs**<br/>and<br/>&bull; **View** or **Modify Network Sets**<br/>and (optional)<br/>&bull; **View** or **Modify Packet Captures** | Network sets can be restricted to a namespace or set to all namespaces to see all flows. |
| Threat feeds | &bull; **View** or **Modify Threat Feeds** | |
| Timeline | &bull; **View Event Logs** or **View All Logs** | |

## Before you begin

* You are signed in with owner or administrator permissions to the Calico Cloud Manager UI.

## Create a custom role and add permissions

1. Click the user icon <IconUser width="20"/> > **Manage Team**.
1. Under the **Roles** tab, click **Add Role**, enter a name and description for the custom role, and then click **Save**.
1. Select the cluster you want to want the role to apply to by clicking **Cluster:** and choosing the cluster.
1. Locate your new role in the list, select **Action** > **Manage permissions** > **Edit**, and the click **Add Permission**.
1. Under **Permission**, choose a permission type from the list.
   Depending on the permission, you may also need to choose a namespace or policy tier.
1. (optional) Click **Add permission** to add more permissions to your role for this cluster.
1. Click **Save** to save these permissions to the role for this cluster.
1. (optional) If you want to add the permissions for another cluster, repeat steps 3 to 7 for the cluster.

## Assign custom roles to a user

1. Select the user icon <IconUser width="20"/> > **Manage Team**.
1. Under the **Users** tab, locate the user in the list and select **Action** > **Edit**.
1. Select the checkboxes for each custom role you want to assign to this user and then click **Save**.

## Export custom roles and apply to other managed clusters

You can export custom roles from one cluster and apply them to another cluster.

:::note
Importing custom roles is fully supported on managed clusters running Calico Cloud 18.3 or higher.
:::

***Prerequisites***

* You connected two or more managed clusters to Calico Cloud.
* You have a managed cluster with one or more custom roles.
* You have `kubectl` administrator permissions for the managed clusters you want to apply custom roles to.

***Procedure***

1. From the cluster menu in the Calico Cloud Manager UI, select the managed cluster that has the custom roles you want to export.
1. Click the user icon <IconUser width="20"/> > **Manage Team**.
1. Under the **Roles** tab, click **Export Custom Roles** and select **Download YAML** to download the custom role definitions.
This file contains definitions for all the custom roles you created in this cluster.
1. For each managed cluster you want to apply the custom roles to, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f roles.<cluster-name>.yaml
   ```

   The custom roles are available immediately for this cluster in the Calico Cloud Manager UI.
