# Give role-based access to an Entra&nbsp;ID group

If you have Microsoft Entra&nbsp;ID configured as your identity provider, you can define role-based access in Calico Cloud and assign that role to an Entra&nbsp;ID (formerly Azure AD) security group.
By managing membership in that security group, you can manage role-based access to Calico Cloud directly from your identity provider portal.

***Prerequisites***

* You have owner or administrator permissions to the Calico Cloud Manager UI.
* You set up Entra&nbsp;ID as your identity provider for Calico Cloud.
  To set up an identity provider for Calico Cloud, open a [support ticket](https://support.tigera.io).
* You have administrator permissions for your organization in the Azure Portal.
* You have the Object ID for an Entra&nbsp;ID security group.
* The **Email** property for all users in the security group has a valid email address.

***Procedure***

1. In Manager UI, click the user icon <IconUser width="20"/> > **Manage Team**.
1. Under the **Roles** tab, click **Add Role** and enter a name and description for the custom role.
   Under **IdP Group Identifier**, enter your Entra&nbsp;ID security group's Object ID and click **Save**.
   :::note
   If you don't see **IdP Group Identifier**, open a [support ticket](https://support.tigera.io) to enable this option.
