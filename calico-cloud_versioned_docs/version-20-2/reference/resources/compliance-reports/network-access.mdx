# Network Access report

To create an Inventory report, create a [`GlobalReport`](../globalreport.mdx) with the `reportType`
set to `network-access`.

The following sample command creates a GlobalReport that results in a daily network access report for
endpoints in the `public` namespace.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata:
  name: daily-public-network-access-report
  labels:
    deployment: production
spec:
  reportType: network-access
  endpoints:
    namespaces:
      names:
        - public
  schedule: 0 0 * * *
EOF
```

:::note

There is a known issue that audit logs do not contain deletion events for resources that were
deleted implicitly as part of a namespace deletion event. Currently, this means policies and pods that have been
deleted in this way may still appear in the reports that cover any period within the next day.

\* Traffic data is determined from flow logs. By default, $[prodname] aggregates flow logs so that flows to
and from pods in the same replica set are summarized if the flows are accepted. (Denied flows are not aggregated this
way by default). This means that the per-endpoint traffic details do not refer specifically to that endpoint, but
rather the set of endpoints specified by the trafficAggregationPrefix.

If you want per-endpoint detail you should turn down the level of aggregation. To do so,
set the value of `flowLogsFileAggregationKindForAllowed` to 1 using a [FelixConfiguration][felixconfig]
