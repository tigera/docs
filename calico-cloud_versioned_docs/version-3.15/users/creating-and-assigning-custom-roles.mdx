# Creating and assigning custom roles

As an administrator, you can create custom, cluster-specific roles that restrict users to particular functions on a cluster.

## Overview

{{prodname}} comes with a set of predefinied global roles that let you give permissions to users based on what they need to do.
For example, a user with the Security global role has a broader set of permissions than a user with the Viewer global role.
These permissions apply to all clusters.

But in some cases these global roles can be too broad.

By creating and assigning custom roles, you can be much more discriminating about what permissions you give users.
For example, you could create a role that allows the user to modify network policy for a particular tier and namespace and gives view access to all other network policies.
Permissions are assigned on a cluster-by-cluster basis.

## Required permissions for common {{prodname}} features

Certain permissions are required for a user to access common {{prodname}} features.

| Feature area | Required permissions | Notes |
| --| -- | -- |
| Alerts | &bull; **View** or **Modify Alerts**<br/>and<br/>&bull;**View Event Logs** or **View All Logs** | |
| Anomaly detection | &bull; **View** or **Modify Alerts**<br/> and <br/>&bull; **View Event Logs** or **View All Logs**| |
| Compliance reports | &bull; **View Compliance Reports** | |
| Dashboard | &bull; **View All Logs**<br/>and<br/>&bull; **View Global Network Sets** or **View Network Sets**<br/>and (optional)<br/>&bull; **View Compliance Reports** | These permissions are required for the dashboard to fully populate. All users are granted limited dashboard metrics by having access to a cluster. |
| Network policies | &bull; **View** or **Modify Policies**<br/>or<br/>&bull; **View** or **Modify Global Policies**<br/>and (optional)<br/>&bull; **View Audit Logs** or **View All Logs** | The **Policies** permissions apply to one or more namespaces. The **Global Policies** permissions apply to the whole cluster. These permissions are also scoped by [policy tier](../network-policy/policy-tiers/tiered-policy.mdx). <br/> <br/>The optional **View Audit Logs** or **View All Logs** let users view the change history on the policies. |
| Service graph | &bull; **View All Logs**<br/>and<br/>&bull; **View** or **Modify Network Sets**<br/>and (optional)<br/>&bull; **View** or **Modify Packet Captures** | Network sets can be restricted to a namespace or set to all namespaces to see all flows. |
| Threat feeds | &bull; **View** or **Modify Threat Feeds** | |
| Timeline | &bull; **View Event Logs** or **View All Logs** | |
