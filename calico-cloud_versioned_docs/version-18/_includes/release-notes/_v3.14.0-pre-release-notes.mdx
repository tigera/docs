### [WIP] Other changes

- Fix incorrect check of CIDR block size in node startup script. [node #468](https://github.com/projectcalico/node/pull/468) (@tmjd)
- Update image to address CVE. [node #460](https://github.com/projectcalico/node/pull/460) (@lmm)
- Release tunnel IP addresses more safely [node #443](https://github.com/projectcalico/node/pull/443) (@caseydavenport)
- Properly release tunnel addresses even if nod object was improperly modified. [node #436](https://github.com/projectcalico/node/pull/436) (@caseydavenport)
- Fix potential tunnel address leak when upgrading from Calico < v3.6 to Calico &#8805; v3.8 [node #430](https://github.com/projectcalico/node/pull/430) (@caseydavenport)
- Run health checks in parallel [node #423](https://github.com/projectcalico/node/pull/423) (@stamm)
- On case of overlapping between host network and default IP pool Calico node start to find a free IP range between `172.16.0.0/16` and `172.31.0.0/16` [node #421](https://github.com/projectcalico/node/pull/421) (@mhmxs)
- In BPF mode, fix that RPF check was bypassed for traffic to local workloads behind a nodeport. [felix #2283](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2283) (@tomastigera)
- In BPF mode, fix some corner cases in conntrack whitelisting and add additional tests. [felix #2281](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2281) (@tomastigera)
- In BPF mode, upgrade from the previous version may result in connections being silently dropped. This is due to adjusting the format of the connection tracking BPF map. [felix #2277](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2277) (@tomastigera)
- Felix can now calculate routes without dependency on Calico IPAM. [felix #2269](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2269) (@caseydavenport)
- In BPF mode, Felix now sets the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl by default to restrict access to the BPF syscall. This behaviour is controlled by the BPFDisableUnprivileged configuration parameter. [felix #2261](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2261) (@fasaxc)
- Calico now supports encryption of all pod-to-pod traffic using wireguard. [felix #2257](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2257) (@robbrockbank)
- The MTU used by the BPF programs when sending ICMP TOO BIG messages in order to control path MTU is now configured by the VXLANMTU configuration parameter. [felix #2251](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2251) (@tomastigera)
- In BPF mode, fix lack of FIB lookup due to using incorrect endianness. [felix #2250](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2250) (@tomastigera)
- The BPF dataplane now handles ICMP error messages as "related" traffic so that they follow the same path back through the dataplane as the packet they respond to. This improves compatibility with path MTU detection and other non-mainline traffic. [felix #2247](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2247) (@tomastigera)
- In BPF dataplane mode, Felix now handles single-block IPAM pools. Previously single-block pools resulted in a collision when programming the dataplane routes. [felix #2245](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2245) (@fasaxc)
- None required [felix #2233](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2233) (@tomastigera)
- None required [felix #2232](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2232) (@tomastigera)
- [Openstack] Allow DHCP from the workload, on kernels where rp_filter doesn't already [felix #2231](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2231) (@nelljerram)
- all-interfaces host endpoints now supports normal network policy in addition to pre-dnat policy [felix #2228](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2228) (@lmm)
- Add FelixConfiguration option for setting route information source [libcalico-go #1222](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/1222) (@caseydavenport)
- Added Wireguard configuration. [libcalico-go #1215](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/1215) (@realgaurav)
- Add a new Profile with allow-all rules named `projectcalico-default-allow`. This profile can be used in host endpoints to provide default-allow in the absence of policy [libcalico-go #1207](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/1207) (@lmm)
- v3 Client can CRUD KubeControllersConfiguration resources [libcalico-go #1205](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/1205) (@spikecurtis)
- New KubeControllersConfiguration API resource [libcalico-go #1203](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/1203) (@spikecurtis)
- Exclude kube-ipvs0 from bird routing [confd #314](https://github.com/projectcalico/confd/pull/314) (@spikecurtis)
- Use mv to place CNI binaries instead of cp [cni-plugin #849](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/849) (@caseydavenport)
- Fix missing hostname binary on ubi-minimal [cni-plugin #848](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/848) (@lmm)
- Change ppc64le base image from debian slim to UBI [cni-plugin #846](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/846) (@DomDeMarc)
- Fix shell stderr redirection in CNI installation script [cni-plugin #842](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/842) (@hanxueluo)

- Fix IPAM garbage collection in etcd mode on clusters where node name does not match Kubernetes node name. [kube-controllers #467](https://github.com/projectcalico/kube-controllers/pull/467) (@caseydavenport)
- Use KubeControllersConfiguration resource for config [kube-controllers #464](https://github.com/projectcalico/kube-controllers/pull/464) (@spikecurtis)
- Fix kube-controllers attempting to clean up non-existent node resources [kube-controllers #461](https://github.com/projectcalico/kube-controllers/pull/461) (@fcuello-fudo)
- kube-controllers can now automatically provision host endpoints for nodes in the cluster [kube-controllers #458](https://github.com/projectcalico/kube-controllers/pull/458) (@lmm)
- Kubernetes network tutorials updated for v1.18. [calico #3447](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/3447) (@tmjd)
- With OpenShift install time resources can be created. This means Calico resources can be created before the Calico components are started. [calico #3338](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/3338) (@tmjd)
