In this article you will learn how to create {{prodname}} policies that securely allow ingress access to a microservice or application.

## Secure ingress access to a microservice

In this example, we have a microservices with four services (sv1, sv2, sv3, and sv4). Let's assume the following requirements:

- Everyone internal to the organization can access `svc1` pods at TCP port 10001
- `svc1` pods can access `svc2` at TCP port 10002
- `svc3` pods can access at TCP port 10003
- `svc2` pods can access `vc4` at TCP ports 10004, 10005

Also, because `svc1` pods pass through a trusted load balancer, we want to allow ingress traffic for the load balancer.

Let's start with securing ingress access to the trusted load balancer. We will use the {{prodname}} **GlobalNetworkSet** resource with cluster-wide scope to define the load balancer IP addresses; this allows the same trusted external endpoints to be used across multiple namespaces.

**GlobalNetworkSet for load balancer**

This GlobalNetworkSet contains the IP addresses for the trusted load balancer.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkSet
metadata:
  name: load-balancer
  labels:
    trusted-ep: "load-balancer"
spec:
  nets:
 # Modify the ip addresses to refer to the ip addresses of load-balancers in your environment
    - 10.0.0.1/32
    - 10.0.0.2/32
```

Next, we will create four network policies.

**NetworkPolicy 1**

This policy allows ingress from the trusted load balancer to pods in `sv1`.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: application.app2-svc1
  namespace: app2-ns
spec:
  tier: application
  order: 500
  selector: (app == "app2" && svc == "svc1")
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: trusted-ep == "load-balancer"
      destination:
        ports:
          - '10001'
  types:
    - Ingress
```

**NetworkPolicy 2**

This policy allows ingress access from `sv1` pods to `sv2` pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: application.app2-svc2
  namespace: app2-ns
spec:
  tier: application
  order: 600
  selector: (app == "app2" && svc == "svc2")
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: svc == "svc1"
      destination:
        ports:
          - '10002'
  types:
    - Ingress
```

**NetworkPolicy 3**

This policy allows ingress access from `svc1` pods to `svc3` pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: application.app2-svc3
  namespace: app2-ns
spec:
  tier: application
  order: 700
  selector: (app == "app2" && svc == "svc3")
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: svc == "svc1"
      destination:
        ports:
          - '10003'
  types:
    - Ingress
```

**NetworkPolicy 4**

This policy allows ingress access from `svc2` pods to `svc4` pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: application.app2-svc4
  namespace: app2-ns
spec:
  tier: application
  order: 800
  selector: (app == "app2" && svc == "svc4")
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: svc == "svc2"
      destination:
        ports:
          - '10003'
          - '10004'
  types:
    - Ingress
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Ingress access to an application" value="Ingress access to an application-1">

## Secure ingress access to an application

In this example, we have an application with frontend, backend, and a database. Let's assume the following requirements:

- Everyone internal to the organization can access the `frontend` at TCP port 10001
- `frontend` can access the `backend` at TCP port 10002
- `backend` can access the `database` at TCP ports 10003, 10004

Also, because frontend pods pass through a trusted load balancer, we want to allow ingress traffic for the load balancer.

Let's start with securing ingress access to the trusted load balancer. We will use the {{prodname}} **GlobalNetworkSet** resource with cluster-wide scope to define the load balancer IP addresses; this allows the same trusted external endpoints to be used across multiple namespaces.

**GlobalNetworkSet for load balancer**

This GlobalNetworkSet contains the IP addresses for the trusted load balancer.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkSet
metadata:
  name: load-balancer
  labels:
    trusted-ep: "load-balancer"
spec:
  nets:
 # Modify the ip addresses to refer to the ip addresses of load-balancers in your environment
    - 10.0.0.1/32
    - 10.0.0.2/32
```

Next, we will create three network policies.

**NetworkPolicy 1**

This policy allows ingress from the trusted load balancer to pods in `frontend`.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: application.app1-frontend
  namespace: app1-ns
spec:
  tier: application
  order: 200
  selector: (app == "app1" && svc == "frontend")
  serviceAccountSelector: ''
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: trusted-ep == "load-balancer"
      destination:
        ports:
          - '10001'
  types:
    - Ingress
```

**NetworkPolicy 2**

This policy allows ingress access from pods in the `frontend` to pods in the `backend`.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: application.app1-backend
  namespace: app1-ns
spec:
  tier: application
  order: 300
  selector: (app == "app1" && svc == "backend")
  serviceAccountSelector: ''
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: svc == "frontend"
      destination:
        ports:
          - '10002'
  types:
    - Ingress
```

**NetworkPolicy 3**

This policy allows ingress access from pods in the `backend` to pods in the `database`.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: application.app1-database
  namespace: app1-ns
spec:
  tier: application
  order: 400
  selector: (app == "app1" && svc == "database")
  serviceAccountSelector: ''
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        selector: svc == "backend"
      destination:
        ports:
          - '10003'
          - '10004'
  types:
    - Ingress
```
