# Scan all images in a Kubernetes cluster

Scan all images in a Kubernetes cluster to achieve a continuous clean bill of health and defense in depth.

Common use cases for scanning in a Kubernetes cluster are:

- Images may pass scanning during the build phase, but they could contain vulnerabilities days or weeks later
- Third-party images that are pulled from public registries are often not scanned in build pipelines and can contain Critical or High vulnerabilities
- Application teams may build one-off images outside of their pipeline to make an emergency patch and fix a critical bug.

## About Image Assurance scanner

The Image Assurance scanner that runs in a Kubernetes cluster is out-of-the-box ready to use without configuration. It runs as a daemonset in a managed cluster where images are located, and is installed on all nodes in the cluster.

Vulnerability detection consists of these steps:

- **Image Assurance scanner** - generates a dependency list Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using Syft
- **Vulnerability lookup** - {{prodname}} uploads the SBOM where packages are matched with known CVEs in the vulnerability databases based on dependencies using Grype

{{prodname}} checks running images for new vulnerabilities every 24 hours and reports scan results to the Image dashboard in Manager UI.

## Before you begin

**Unsupported**
- OpenShift
- GCP-Kubeadm
- AWS-Kubeadm
- AKS
- GKE

**Required**

- Cluster
 - Containerd is the container runtime
 - Containerd must be using overlayfs or native file system snapshotter

## How to
- [Get latest version of Image Assurance](#get-latest-version-of-image-assurance)
- [Enable scanner](#enable-scanner)
- [Customize scanner settings](#customize-scanner-settings)
- [Disable scanner](#disable-scanner)

### Get latest version of Image Assurance

1. On the **Managed Clusters** page, select the cluster from the list, and click **Reinstall**.
1. Copy the updated installation script command and run it against your cluster.

### Enable scanner

To enable the scanner for all nodes in the cluster:

1. Modify the `imageassurances` custom resource.

```bash
   kubectl edit imageassurances default
   ```

2. Set the `clusterScanner` field to `Enabled` and save the file.

The cluster scanner is deployed as a container inside the `tigera-image-assurance-crawdad` daemonset.

3. Verify that a new container with name, `cluster-scanner` is created inside the daemonset.

Thatâ€™s it. Images will start scanning. For help, see [Understand scan results in Manager UI](../understanding-scan-results).

### Customize scanner settings

To change default settings, modify the `imageassurances` custom resource.

- Container runtime socket path

Set the `criSocketPath` field to the path of the container runtime socket. Default: `/run/containerd/containerd.sock`

- Containerd file system root path

Set the `containerdVolumeMountPath`. Default: `/var/lib/containerd/`.

### Disable scanner

1. Modify the `imageassurances` custom resource.

```bash
 kubectl edit imageassurances default
   ```

2. Set the `clusterScanner` field to `Disabled` and save the file. This deletes the cluster scanner container from the daemonset from your cluster.
