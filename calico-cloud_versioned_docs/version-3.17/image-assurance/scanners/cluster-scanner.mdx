# Enable automatic image scanning inside a cluster

## Big picture

Scan Kubernetes workloads automatically using {{prodname}} Image Assurance cluster scanner.


## Before you begin

**Cluster requirements**

To be included in scan results, cluster must be:

- Using containerd as the container runtime.
- Containerd must be using `overlayfs` or `native` file system snapshotter.

**Image requirements**

- Workloads must be running an image that has RepoDigest ID

## How to

- [Enable cluster scanner](#enable-the-cluster-scanner)
- [Configure cluster scanner](#configure-cluster-scanner)
- [Disable cluster scanner](#disable-cluster-scanner)

### Enable the cluster scanner

1. In your cluster, enable the cluster scanner by modifying the `imageassurances` custom resource.

   ```shell
      kubectl edit imageassurances default
   ```

2. Set the `clusterScanner` field to `Enabled` and save the file.

3. This will deploy the cluster scanner as a daemonset in your cluster. The scanner is deployed as a container inside `tigera-image-assurance-crawdad`
daemonset. You can verify that the scanner is deployed by verifying that a new container with name `cluster-scanner` is created inside the daemonset.


### Configure cluster scanner

You can configure the cluster scanner with custom settings. To do so, modify the `imageassurances` custom resource.

1. To modify container runtime socket path used by the cluster scanner, set the `criSocketPath` field to the path of the container runtime socket.
The default value is set to `/run/containerd/containerd.sock`.

2. To modify the containerd file system root path, modify `containerdVolumeMountPath`. The default value is set to `/var/lib/containerd/`.

### Disable the cluster scanner

1. You can disable the cluster scanner by modifying the `imageassurances` custom resource.

   ```shell
    kubectl edit imageassurances default
   ```

2. Set the `clusterScanner` field to `Disabled` and save the file. This will delete the cluster scanner container from the daemonset from your cluster.
