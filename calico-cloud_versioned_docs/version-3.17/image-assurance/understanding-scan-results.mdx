# Understand image scan results in Manager UI

This article provides help using Image Assurance in Manager UI:

- [All Scanned Images dashboard](#all-scanned-images-dashboard)
  - [Scan settings panel](#scan-settings-panel)
  - [Exclude vulnerabilities from scan results](#exclude-vulnerabilities-from-scan-results)
  - [Export scan results](#export-scan-results)
  - [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
- [Running images tab](#running-images-tab)

- [Vulnerability exceptions dashboard](#vulnerability-exceptions-dashboard)

## All Scanned Images dashboard

In the left navbar in Manager UI, click **Image Assurance**, **All Scanned Images**.

This dashboard lets you:
- View results of image scanning and assess vulnerabilities prior to runtime
- View running images in your cluster and remediate CVEs

### Scan results tab

In this panel, you can:

- View all scanned images for CVEs
- Change default scan settings
- Exclude vulnerabilities from scan results

Scan results for Image Assurance is based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3 (CVSS Scores). The default Pass, Warn, and Fail values will work for the majority of {{prodname}} deployments. However, you may need to change the defaults because of security requirements.

| CVSS v3 scores                              | Image Assurance mapping and defaults | Default settings     |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 0.0 – (None)<br />0.1 – 3.9 (Low)           | Pass = < 3.8                         | Low                  |
| 4.0 – 6.9 (Medium)                          | Warn = 3.9                           | Medium severity – 7  |
| 7.0 – 8.9 (High)<br />9.0 – 10.0 (Critical) | Fail = 7.0                           | Critical or high – 8 |


**Changing the CVSS thresholds**

On the right panel, click the **Settings** icon. When changing the CVSS threshold values, note the following:
- Changes to values take effect immediately, and alter the scan results for images already in the system
- If you are using admission controller policies, changing a value may allow pods in your Kubernetes cluster that were previously blocked, to now be deployed or vice versa.

**Why do I have images with `unknown` results**?

The Image Assurance cluster scanner is not enabled and running, or has not yet reported results.

**How long does it take for scan results?**

Anywhere from 2-10 minutes. The variability occurs because the scanner watches, reports, and then sleeps to balance efficiency and resources.

**Download Scanner link**

This link goes to the docs with steps to integrate the Image Assurance scanner as part of your build pipeline. 

### Scan settings panel

**What is the Enable Runtime View checkbox?**

Runtime view allows you to view vulnerable images that are running in your cluster. You can then remediate the vulnerabilities using the CVSS scores as a guideline to triage CVEs.

If you disable Runtime View, some runtime information for existing images will remain in the system.

**What are the `API URL` and `API Token` fields used for?**

They are used to authenticate API requests between the scanner to the Image Assurance API if you have integrated the Image Assurance scanner in your build pipeline.

### Exclude vulnerabilities from scan results

In some cases, you may want to exclude specific vulnerabilities from your scan results. For example, you may determine that a warning is a false positive because of the way you are using an affected package. By creating a vulnerability exception, you can configure Image Assurance to ignore a CVE for a specific image, all images from the same repo, or for all images.

1. Go to **Image Assurance**, **All Scanned Images**. 
2. Select an image from the list.
3. Click one of the packages listed in the side panel.
3. Select a CVE and click **Actions**, **Add Exception**.
4. From the **Add Exception** dialog, select a scope, add a description, and click **Save**. The new vulnerability exception is immediately applied to your scan results.
5. To view all vulnerability exceptions, go to: **Image Assurance**, **Vulnerability Exceptions**.

:::caution 
Adding a vulnerability exception can significantly change how Image Assurance determines image health. 
- **Maximum CVSS score** - an image’s maximum CVSS score may be reduced to a lower score. An exception could eliminate the vulnerability with the highest CVSS score for an image. 
- **Scan results** - scan results for /Pass/Warn/Fail could change because they are based on the maximum CVSS score. For example, Fail could change to Warn, and Warn could change to Pass. 
- **Vulnerability global alerts** - alerts may no longer be triggered. Alerts are triggered based on scan results or maximum CVSS score values of images. 
- **Admission controller** - pods could be created where they were previously blocked. Admission controller policies are based on vulnerability information (scan result and/or maximum CVSS score).

### Export scan results

You can export scan results either from **All Scanned Images** tab or the **Running images** tab. The export generates a CSV file with image and CVE metadata for the current list of images you have selected (based on your current filter options). Options include:

- **Export one row for each image and CVE ID** exports a unique image + CVE combination for each row. For example, if an image has 10 CVEs, 10 rows are created (1 for each CVE).
- **Export one row per image** exports one row for each image, with all associated CVEs condensed into a single column.
- **Export for scanning** exports a JSON file that contains image URLs which can be used as an input to the scanner.

:::note

Images with no associated CVEs are not included in the exported data (regardless of whether or not it is included by the filters).

:::

### Running Images tab

This tab shows CVEs associated with running pods in your cluster so you can assess pod vulnerability and remediate. For example, you can see image exposure by viewing the  **Clusters** and **Running Instances** columns that show the number of running instances in clusters that are connected to {{prodname}}.

### Troubleshooting 

#### No results in the Running Images tab

- The Image Assurance feature may not be enabled 
- If you have modified the default containerd socket path (`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`), runtime information will not be available. To update the CRI socket path to collect pod metadata for the cluster, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl patch imageassurance default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"criSocketPath":"<path-to-cri-socket>"}}'
   ```
   See [the installation reference](../reference/installation/api.mdx#image-assurance.operator.tigera.io/v1.ImageAssuranceSpec) for more details on the ImageAssurance CR.

#### Registry path field is blank in the All Scanned Images dashboard

If this field is blank, it means that {{prodname}} cannot access the metadata. For example, images from Docker Hub do not specify the registry in the image metadata.

## Vulnerability exceptions dashboard

In the left navbar in Manager UI, click **Image Assurance**, **Vulnerability Exceptions**.

This panel displays vulnerabilities that you've excluded from your scan results (created in the All Scanned Images dashboard).

## Next steps

- [Set up alerts on vulnerabilities](set-up-alerts.mdx)
- Create [policy](install-the-admission-controller.mdx) to block vulnerable containers from deploying to your cluster
