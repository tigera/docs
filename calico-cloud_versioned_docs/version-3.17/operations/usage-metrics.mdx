# Usage and billing

{variables.prodname} Admins can view product usage metrics on the **Usage Metrics** page of the UI.

You can view the node hours and ingested data consumed by each managed cluster each month, the cost in node hours, and any data overage cost. You can also download an invoice and export to CSV.

## How NodeHours Cost is calculated

To calculate **Node Hours**, divide the vCPU of each node by four, round up, and then add them together. (Note this is different from adding up all the vCPU and then dividing by four, because it is done on a per-node basis.)

## How Ingested Data is calculated

{variables.prodname} provides users with 200 GB per month of ingested data, which is included in the standard pricing before overage charges are incurred. Additional data usage is charged at a rate of $0.25 / GB / month.
