# Calico Cloud architecture

## {variables.prodname} security

{variables.prodname} architecture is based on the {variables.prodname} multi-cluster management feature. {variables.prodname} manages the control plane, and you connect your clusters (called **managed clusters**) to the control plane. Communication between the {variables.prodname} control plane and managed clusters is secured using TLS tunnels.

The components that secure communications between the {variables.prodname} control plane and managed clusters are:

- **{variables.prodname} tunnel server** - accepts secure TLS connections from managed clusters
- **Guardian** - an agent that runs in each managed cluster that proxies communication between {variables.prodname} components and managed cluster components

All connections go through the {variables.prodname} tunnel server and Guardian. The only exception is during installation and upgrade when managed clusters connect to {variables.prodname} using TLS connections to get install/update resources, register the cluster, and report the status of the install/update.

The {variables.prodname} tunnel is initiated by Guardian on the managed cluster. The {variables.prodname} control plane does not initiate new connections to the managed cluster outside of the tunnel. However, there are connections that go through the {variables.prodname} tunnel server that are initiated from the control plane; for example, when a user interacts with the Manager UI, or when configuration needs to be pushed into the managed cluster.

## Managed cluster components

The following diagram shows the major components in a managed cluster, followed by component descriptions.

| Container threat detection     | A threat detection engine that analyzes observed file and process activity to detect known malicious and suspicious activity. Monitors the following types of suspicious activity within containers:<br/><br />&bull; Access to sensitive system files and directories<br />&bull; Defense evasion<br />&bull; Discovery<br />&bull; Execution<br />&bull; Persistence<br />&bull; Privilege escalation<br/><br />Includes these components:<br /><br />**Runtime Security Operator**<br />An operator to manage and reconcile container threat defense components.<br/><br />**Runtime Reporter Pods**<br />Pods running on each node in the cluster to perform the detection activity outlined above.They send activity reports to Elasticsearch for analysis by {variables.prodname}. | TCP  to Kubernetes API server                                |
| Compliance                     | Generates compliance reports for the Kubernetes cluster. Reports are based on archived flow and audit logs for Calico Cloud resources, plus any audit logs you’ve configured for Kubernetes resources in the Kubernetes API server. Compliance reports provide the following high-level information:<br /><br />&bull; Endpoints explicitly protected using ingress or egress policy<br />&bull; Policies and services<br />   - Policies and services associated with endpoints<br />   - Policy audit logs <br />&bull; Traffic<br />   - Allowed ingress/egress traffic to/from namespaces, and to/from the internet Compliance includes these components: <br /><br />**compliance-snapshotter** <br />Handles listing of required Kubernetes and {variables.prodname}configuration and pushes snapshots to Elasticsearch. Snapshots give you visibility into configuration changes, and how the cluster-wide configuration has evolved within a reporting interval.<br /><br />**compliance-reporter**<br />Handles report generation. Reads configuration history from Elasticsearch and determines time evolution of cluster-wide configuration, including relationships between policies, endpoints, services, and network sets. Data is then passed through a zero-trust aggregator to determine the “worst-case outliers” in the reporting interval.<br /><br />**compliance-controller**<br />Reads report configuration and manages creation, deletion, and monitoring of report generation jobs.<br /><br />**compliance-benchmarker**<br />A daemonset that runs checks in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark on each node so you can see if Kubernetes is securely deployed.<br /> | &bull; TCP 8080 to Guardian<br />&bull; TCP 6443 to Kubernetes API server |

| Image Assurance                | Identifies vulnerabilities in container images that you deploy to Kubernetes clusters.  Components of interest are: <br /><br />**Admission controller**<br />Uses Kubernetes Validating Webhook Configuration to control which images can be used to create pods based on scan results. <br /><br />**API**<br />Isolates tenant data and authorizes all external access to Image Assurance data. **Note:** {variables.prodname} does not store registry credentials in its database and does not pull customer images into the {variables.prodname} control plane.<br /> | &bull;  TCP 8080 to Guardian<br /> &bull;  TCP 6443 to Kubernetes API server |
| Kubernetes API server          | A Kubernetes component that validates and configures data for the API objects (for example, pods, services, and others). <br /> | TCP 6443 (from all components)                               |
