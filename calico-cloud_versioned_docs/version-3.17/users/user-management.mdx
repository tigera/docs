:::note

The Owner role cannot be assigned to new users. The only Owner is the user who created the {{prodname}} account.

:::

## Add your own identity provider

{{prodname}} works with any identity provider that supports [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/). For example, OKTA, Google, and Azure AD.

To add an identity provider, open a [Support ticket](https://support.tigera.io/).

### Azure AD requirements

To add Azure AD as your identity provider, create an Active Directory "App Registration" with a Redirect URI of type "Web" set to https://auth.calicocloud.io/login/callback.

Enable "ID Token" for implicit flows.

Add the following Microsoft Graph API delegated permissions:

- Directory.Read.All
- User.Read
- OpenId permissions:
  - email
  - openid
  - profile
