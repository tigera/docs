# Calico Cloud release notes

## September 11, 2023 (version 17.1.1)

### New features and enhancements

* We redesigned a section of the Image Assurance UI to make it easier to see how vulnerable an image is.
* We made improvements to the way Container Threat Detection processes large volumes of alerts.

### Bug fixes

* We fixed a problem that caused the user interface to crash when a user attempted to edit a policy.
* We fixed a problem that prevented certain images from being scanned.

## September 5, 2023 (version 17.1.0)

### New features and enhancements

#### Improvements to software versioning for Calico Cloud installations on managed clusters

We've made it easier to see what version of Calico Cloud you're running or installing on a managed cluster.
Now you can:
* view the Calico Cloud version number for each connected cluster from the Managed Clusters page
* see when an update is available for a managed cluster
* select a specific Calico Cloud version to install when you connect a cluster

#### Security Events UI page

Alerts corresponding to detections generated by container threat detection will now be published to the Security Events UI page, found within the Threat Defense left navigation menu item.

On this page, for every security event detected, users can view:

* security event name
* security event type
* severity level
* a description of what suspicious activity has been detected
* impacted assets (pod and namespace)
* attack vector type
* Mitre tactic and techniques associated with the detection
* mitigation recommendation
* additional metadata and context associated with the detection.

Alerts will continue to also appear on the Alerts UI page.

For more information, see [Security event management](../threat/security-event-management.mdx).

### Bug fixes

* Runtime Security alerts now correctly show the generated_time as the time the alert was generated. Previously they incorrectly showed the time when the underlying event which caused the alert was generated.
* Runtime Security alerts now correctly show the associated Mitre information.

### Known issues

* Enabling WAF and Container Threat Detection through the UI is not possible for clusters running Kubernetes v1.27+. Both features can be enabled using kubectl.
* If you connected your cluster to Calico Cloud using Helm before the release of version 17.1.0, reinstalling or upgrading to any version of Calico Cloud may result in an error: "Error: rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists."
  Previously, the `installers.operator.calicocloud.io` custom resource definition (CRD) installed by Helm required manual upgrades.
  After the release of Calico Cloud 17.1.0, this CRD is updated automatically, but this change causes errors the first time you attempt to reinstall or upgrade Calico Cloud on a cluster that was connected using Helm before the release of Calico Cloud 17.1.0.

  As a workaround, label the CRD so that it is managed by Helm by running the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl patch crd installers.operator.calicocloud.io -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"meta.helm.sh/release-name":"calico-cloud-crds","meta.helm.sh/release-namespace":"calico-cloud"},"labels":{"app.kubernetes.io/managed-by":"Helm"}}}'
  ```

  This allows you to successfully reinstall or upgrade to Calico Cloud by following the procedure in [Upgrade Calico Cloud](../get-started/upgrade-cluster.mdx).

### Security updates

* Runtime security upgraded to [golang 1.20.7](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20.7), which includes security updates.
* We rebuilt `cc-operator` and `cc-cni-config-scanner`, which has reduced the number of CVEs.

## August 21, 2023 (version 17.0.0)

### New features and enhancements

#### New policy recommendations engine for namespace isolation

{{prodname}} has added a new policy recommendations engine that automatically generates staged policies for namespace isolation within your cluster. [Policy recommendations](../network-policy/recommendations/policy-recommendations).

#### Destination-based routing for egress gateways

{{prodname}} introduces a new mode for egress gateways that can leverage destination-based routing. Destination-based routing for egress gateways allows operators associated with a destination that is external to a Kubernetes cluster (for example, IP address or CIDR), to a specific egress gateway deployment. [Egress gateways](../networking/egress/egress-gateway-on-prem).

#### Support for DNS rules in clusters using NodeLocal DNSCache

{{prodname}} has added support for DNS rules in clusters using NodeLocal DNSCache. Also related, there is new documentation on using Calico policy to secure DNS traffic within the cluster with NodeLocal DNSCache enabled. [Use NodeLocal DNSCache in your cluster](../networking/configuring/node-local-dns-cache).

#### Improved UI for configuring Workload-based Web Application Firewall (WAF)

{{prodname}} includes updates to the UI that allows you to select which services are enabled for the Workload-based Web Application Firewall. [Web application firewall](../threat/web-application-firewall).

  See [Image Assurance containerized scanner](https://quay.io/repository/tigera/image-assurance-scanner-cli) to pull the latest image.
* Substantial UI improvements including a new package-centric view of images

### Known issues

* The canvas on Service Graph may zoom and pan unexpectedly when modifying Views or Layers
* Dragging tiers to modify their order is currently not working in the UI, though you can still change its order when editing a tier
* Policy recommendations may generate rules with ports and protocols for intra-namespace traffic.
  This will be modified in the next patch release to exclude ports and protocols and provide an option to Allow or Pass this traffic.

## June 6, 2023

### New features and enhancements

#### In-cluster scanning with Image Assurance

Calico Cloud now includes the ability to scan and monitor the images running in your Kubernetes clusters for new vulnerabilities.
In-cluster scanning will scan any new images not previously scanned, and continuously monitor the BOM (Bill of Materials) for running images that have prior scan results.

#### New detectors for container threat detection

We've added several new detectors for container threat detection.
These detectors help identify unsanctioned use of network tools, task scheduling, container admin and Docker commands, and much more.

## September 12, 2022

### Image Assurance is GA

Image Assurance is now released for general availability.

With Image Assurance, DevOps and platform teams can scan images in public and private registries, including images that are automatically discovered in connected clusters.
Image Assurance provides a runtime view into risk, based on known vulnerabilities.
It also offers admission controller policies to block resources in Kubernetes from creating containers with vulnerable images from entering your cluster.

#### Changes from the tech preview version

**New Image Assurance CLI scanner**
Image scanning is now configured and performed by the `tigera-scanner` CLI.
You can integrate `tigera-scanner` into your CI/CD pipelines to ensure builds are checked by Image Assurance before deployment.
You can also use the CLI scanner offline and on-demand for ad hoc scanning and emergency patching.

**Export options for vulnerability scan results and runtime views**

We've made it easier for platform operators to share Image Assurance scan results and runtime views with these export options:

* Export one row per image or one row per image and CVE.
* Export CSV or JSON files.

To get started see, [Image Assurance](../image-assurance).

### Malware detection is GA

Malware detection is now released for general availability.

Calico Cloud's malware detection identifies malicious files in your cluster and generates alerts.
Calico Cloud uses eBPF-based monitoring to log file hashes of programs running in your cluster.
If there's a match to known malware from our threat intelligence library, you receive an alert.
You can view your alerts on the _Alerts_ page on Manager UI.

To get started see, [Malware Detection](../threat/container-threat-detection.mdx))

## July 27, 2022

Improvement: Export logs to a SIEM

To help meet your compliance requirements, we've added documentation to export logs to a SIEM (syslog, Splunk, or Amazon S3). See [Export logs to a SIEM](../visibility/elastic/archive-storage.mdx).

## July 7, 2022

### New feature: Distributed Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Envoy

![tech-preview](/img/calico-cloud/tech-preview.svg)

{{prodname}} now includes the option to enable Web Application Firewall (WAF) rulesets when using Envoy as a daemonset. This enables operators to implement an additional layer of security and threat detection for application layer traffic. See [Workload-based Web Application Firewall (WAF)](../threat/web-application-firewall.mdx).

### New Feature: Configuration option to use DNS rules with StagedNetworkPolicies

{{prodname}} has added a new configuration option in Felix (`DNSPolicyMode`) that lets you audit DNS rules with StagedNetworkPolicies. There is a small performance trade off if you enable this option, so we recommended to disabling it when it’s not required. See [Felix configuration](../reference/resources/felixconfig.mdx#dnspolicymode).

### Improvement: Additional predefined RBAC options

{{prodname}} now supports 3 more pre-defined RBAC controls (devops, security and compliance persona) for role assignment.

### Improvement: Anomaly detection deployment

![tech-preview](/img/calico-cloud/tech-preview.svg)

{{prodname}} has made the configuration and deployment of anomaly detection jobs for threat detection and performance hotspots more granular, allowing you to selectively enable jobs depending on your use case. See [Detect and alert on anomalies](../threat/security-anomalies.mdx).

### Improvement: Manager UI now displays cluster installation progress and streaming logs

{{prodname}} now displays information about managed cluster install progress right in the UI.

After you run the install command (**Connect Cluster** wizard in Managed Clusters), installation progress is automatically displayed along with logs for the managed cluster.

## May 10, 2022

### New feature: Visibility into usage metrics

{{prodname}} now displays information about cloud usage metrics. This will provide visibility into the node hours and data ingested for consumption-based invoices.

Account owners can click the new "Usage Metrics" button at the bottom of the left navbar to navigate to the new page.

### Expanded platform support: AKS with managed Calico

Installation works on clusters with Calico deployed by AKS.

## April 26, 2022

### New feature: Malware detection

![tech-preview](/img/calico-cloud/tech-preview.svg)

{{prodname}} introduces malware detection in tech preview, which uses eBPF-based monitoring to log observed file hashes of programs running in your {{prodname}} Kubernetes clusters. Malware detection identifies malicious files by comparing observed file hashes with our threat intelligence library of known malware, and generates alerts when malware is detected in your cluster. Alerts can be viewed on the Alerts page of Manager UI.

**If you started using {{prodname}} before January 24, 2022**, you must upgrade your existing cluster to get malware detection:

1. Navigate to the **Managed Clusters** page.
1. Select the cluster from the list, and click **Reinstall**.
1. Copy the updated install script command and run it against your cluster.

## April 20, 2022

### Improved installation

We’ve updated the {{prodname}} installation process to improve security, reduce dependencies on utilities (such as bash), and allow you to customize the name of your connected clusters.

The {{prodname}} installation process will now require running a `kubectl apply` command instead of a bash script. Additionally, the installation script has been moved behind an authenticated endpoint. The updated install script is now available on the **Managed Clusters** page of the {{prodname}} UI.

**If you started using {{prodname}} before January 24, 2022**, you must upgrade your existing cluster to get these changes:

1. Navigate to the **Managed Clusters** page.
1. Select the cluster from the list, and click **Reinstall**.
1. Copy the updated install script command and run it against your cluster.

## April 19, 2022

### New feature: Image Assurance

![tech-preview](/img/calico-cloud/tech-preview.svg)

{{prodname}} introduces Image Assurance in tech preview, enabling DevOps and platform teams to scan images in public and private registries, and images that are automatically discovered in connected clusters. Image Assurance provides a runtime view into risk, based on discovered vulnerabilities. It also offers admission controller policies to enforce how vulnerable images are used to create resources within Kubernetes.

To get started see, [Image Assurance](../image-assurance).
