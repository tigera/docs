description: Define network connectivity for endpoints using policy rules and label selectors.
---

## Big picture

Use {{prodname}} policy rules and label selectors that match {{prodname}} workload endpoints to define network connectivity.

## Value

Using label selectors to identify the endpoints (pods) that a policy applies to, or that should be selected by policy rules, means you can define policy without knowing the IP addresses of the endpoints. This is ideal for handling dynamic workloads with ephemeral IPs (such as Kubernetes pods).

## How to

Read [Get started with Calico policy](calico-network-policy.mdx) and [Kubernetes policy](../../get-started/training/tutorials/kubernetes-network-policy.mdx), which cover all the basics of using label selectors in policies to select endpoints the policies apply to, or in policy rules.
