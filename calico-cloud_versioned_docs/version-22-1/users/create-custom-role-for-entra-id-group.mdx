# Give role-based access to an Entra&nbsp;ID group

If you have Microsoft Entra&nbsp;ID configured as your identity provider, you can define role-based access in Calico Cloud and assign roles to an Entra&nbsp;ID (formerly Azure AD) security group.
By managing membership in that security group, you can manage role-based access to Calico Cloud directly from your identity provider portal.

## Prerequisites

* You are signed in to the web console with owner or administrator permissions.
* Entra&nbsp;ID is set up as an identity provider for Calico Cloud.
  To set up an identity provider for Calico Cloud, open a [support ticket](https://support.tigera.io).
* You have administrator permissions for your organization in the Azure Portal.
* You have the Object ID for an Entra&nbsp;ID security group.
* The **Email** property for all users in the security group has a valid email address.

## Add an Entra&nbsp;ID security group and assign role-based permissions for Calico Cloud

1. In the web console, click the user icon <IconUser width="20"/> > **Manage Team**.
1. Select the **Roles** tab, click the **Add IdP Group** button, and then enter the following information:
   * **IdP Group Name**: Enter a name for the group that will be displayed in the web console.
   * **IdP Group Identifier**: Enter the Object ID for the Entra&nbsp;ID security group.
   * (Optional) **Description**: Enter a description for the group.
   :::note
   If you don't see an **Add IdP Group** button, your organization does not have an identity provider configured.
   To set up an identity provider for Calico Cloud, open a [support ticket](https://support.tigera.io).
