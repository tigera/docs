# Customizing your ingress gateway

You can specify core configuration elements of your ingress gateway by specifying a configuration in the `GatewayAPI` resource.

## Customizing an ingress gateway with the `GatewayAPI` resource

Many customizations are available for the `GatewayAPI` resource.
This resource has fields that allow some aspects of Gateway deployments to be customized.
For example:
- `spec.gatewayDeployment.spec.template.metadata` allows arbitrary labels or annotations to be added to the pod that is created to implement each configured Gateway.
- `spec.gatewayDeployment.spec.template.spec.nodeSelector` allows control over where gateway implementation pods are scheduled.
- `spec.gatewayDeployment.spec.template.spec.containers` allows control over the memory and CPU that the gateway implementation pods can use.
- `spec.gatewayControllerDeployment.spec.template.spec.nodeSelector` allows control over where the gateway controller is scheduled.
