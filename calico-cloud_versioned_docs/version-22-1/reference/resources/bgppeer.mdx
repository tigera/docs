# BGP peer

import Selectors from '@site/calico-cloud_versioned_docs/version-22-1/_includes/content/_selectors.mdx';

A BGP peer resource (`BGPPeer`) represents a remote BGP peer with
which the node(s) in a $[prodname] cluster will peer.
Configuring BGP peers allows you to peer a $[prodname] network
with your datacenter fabric (e.g. ToR). For more
information on cluster layouts, see $[prodname]'s documentation on
[$[prodname] over IP fabrics](../architecture/design/l3-interconnect-fabric.mdx).

For `kubectl` commands, the following case-insensitive aliases may be used to specify the resource type on the CLI: `bgppeer.projectcalico.org`, `bgppeers.projectcalico.org` as well as abbreviations such as `bgppeer.p` and `bgppeers.p`.

## Sample YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: some.name
spec:
  node: rack1-host1
  peerIP: 192.168.1.1
  asNumber: 63400
```

| sourceAddress            | Specifies whether and how to configure a source address for the peerings generated by this BGPPeer resource. Default value "UseNodeIP" means to configure the node IP as the source address. "None" means not to configure a source address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | "UseNodeIP", "None"                                                                         | string                      | "UseNodeIP"                                                                  |
| failureDetectionMode     | Specifies whether and how to detect loss of connectivity on the peerings generated by this BGPPeer resource. Default value "None" means nothing beyond BGP's own (slow) hold timer. "BFDIfDirectlyConnected" means to use BFD when the peer is directly connected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | "None", "BFDIfDirectlyConnected"                                                            | string                      | "None"                                                                       |
| restartMode              | Specifies restart behaviour to configure on the peerings generated by this BGPPeer resource. Default value "GracefulRestart" means traditional graceful restart. "LongLivedGracefulRestart" means LLGR according to draft-uttaro-idr-bgp-persistence-05.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | "GracefulRestart", "LongLivedGracefulRestart"                                               | string                      | "GracefulRestart"                                                            |
| maxRestartTime           | Restart time that is announced by BIRD in the BGP graceful restart capability and that specifies how long the neighbor would wait for the BGP session to re-establish after a restart before deleting stale routes. When specified, this is configured as the graceful restart timeout when `RestartMode` is "GracefulRestart", and as the LLGR stale time when `RestartMode` is "LongLivedGracefulRestart". When not specified, the BIRD defaults are used, which are 120s for "GracefulRestart" and 3600s for "LongLivedGracefulRestart". Note: extra care should be taken when changing this configuration, as it may break networking in your cluster. |                                                                                             | duration                    | None                                                                         |
| birdGatewayMode          | Specifies the BIRD "gateway" mode, i.e. method for computing the immediate next hop for each received route, for peerings generated by this BGPPeer resource. Default value "Recursive" means "gateway recursive". "DirectIfDirectlyConnected" means to configure "gateway direct" when the peer is directly connected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | "Recursive", "DirectIfDirectlyConnected"                                                    | string                      | "Recursive"                                                                  |
| numAllowedLocalASNumbers | The number of local AS numbers to allow in the AS path for received routes. This disables BGP loop prevention and should only be used if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                             | integer                     | `nil` (BIRD will default to 0 meaning no change to loop prevention behavior) |
| ttlSecurity              | Enables the generalized TTL security mechanism (GTSM) which protects against spoofed packets by ignoring received packets with a smaller than expected TTL value. The provided value is the number of hops (edges) between the peers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 0 - 255                                                                                     | 8-bit integer               | `nil` (results in BIRD configuration `ttl security off`)                     |

| externalNetwork | Name of the external network to which this peer belongs. | - | string | |
| reachableBy              | Adds a static route that may be needed to connect to a peer. In some cases, not having a static route for BGP peering results in route flapping. By adding the address of the gateway that the peer is connected to, a static route is added to prevent route flapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The address of the gateway that the peer is connected to                                    | string                      |                                                                              |
| nextHopMode              | Specifies the method of calculating the next hop attribute for received routes. This replaces and expands the deprecated KeepOriginalNextHop field. Users should use this setting to control the next hop attribute for a BGP peer. When this is set, the value of the keepOriginalNextHop field is ignored. If neither keepOriginalNextHop or nextHopMode is specified, BGP's default behavior is used. Default value “Auto” means to apply BGP’s default behavior. "Self" means to configure "next hop self;" in "bird.cfg". "Keep" means to configure "next hop keep;" in "bird.cfg".                                                                   | "Auto", "Self", "Keep"                                                                      | string                      | "Auto"                                                                       |
| reversePeering | Specifies whether Calico automatically generates reverse peerings for nodes selected by the peerSelector. If set to Manual, a separate BGPPeer must be created for the reverse peering. | "Auto", "Manual" | string | "Auto" |

:::tip

The cluster-wide default local AS number used when speaking with a peer is controlled by the
[BGPConfiguration resource](bgpconfig.mdx). That value can be overridden per-node by using the `bgp` field of
the [node resource](node.mdx).

:::

### BGPPassword

:::note

BGP passwords must be 80 characters or fewer. If a password longer than that
is configured, the BGP sessions with that password will fail to be established.

:::

| Field        | Description                     | Schema            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| secretKeyRef | Get the password from a secret. | [KeyRef](#keyref) |

### KeyRef

KeyRef tells $[prodname] where to get a BGP password. The referenced Kubernetes
secret must be in the same namespace as the $[nodecontainer] pod.

| Field | Description               | Schema |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ------ |
| name  | The name of the secret    | string |
| key   | The key within the secret | string |

:::warning

$[prodname] must be able to read the referenced secret.

This means that the `calico-node` ServiceAccount must have permissions to `list, get, watch` the secret referenced in the KeyRef.

In practice, this can be done by creating a Role (which allows to `list, get, watch` the secret) and a RoleBinding (which grants the Role's permission to the `calico-node` ServiceAccount).

Example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: bgp-passwords-reader
  namespace: calico-system
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]

    verbs: ["list", "watch", "get"]

## Peer scopes

BGP Peers can exist at either global or node-specific scope. A peer's scope
determines which `$[nodecontainer]`s will attempt to establish a BGP session with that peer.
If `$[nodecontainer]` has a `listenPort` set in `BGPConfiguration`, it will be used in peering.

### Global peer

To assign a BGP peer a global scope, omit the `node` and `nodeSelector` fields. All nodes in
the cluster will attempt to establish BGP connections with it

### Node-specific peer

A BGP peer can also be node-specific. When the `node` field is included, only the specified node
will peer with it. When the `nodeSelector` field is included, the nodes with labels that match that selector
will peer with it.
