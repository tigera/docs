# Tigera Client library

$[prodname] provides and consumes a client library in Go that allows developers to work with $[prodname] resources. The
client library can be used to get, list, watch, create, delete and update custom resources, such as network policies much
like the [client-go project](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) does for native Kubernetes resources.

To learn more about the Tigera client library and how to use it, see the Tigera API project [README](https://github.com/tigera/api/blob/master/README.md) or
the [github.com/tigera/api Go module page](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tigera/api).
