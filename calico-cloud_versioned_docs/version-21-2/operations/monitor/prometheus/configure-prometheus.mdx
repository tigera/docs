# Configure Prometheus

## Updating Denied Packets Rules

This is an example of how to modify the sample rule created by the sample manifest.
The process of updating rules is the same as for user created rules (documented below).

- Save the current alert rule:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n tigera-prometheus get prometheusrule -o yaml > calico-prometheus-alert-rule-dp.yaml
  ```

- Make necessary edits to the alerting rules then apply the updated manifest.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f calico-prometheus-alert-rule-dp.yaml
  ```

Your changes should be applied in a few seconds by the prometheus-config-reloader
container inside the prometheus pod launched by the prometheus-operator
(usually named `prometheus-<your-prometheus-instance-name>`).

As an example, the range query in this Manifest is 10 seconds.

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: calico-prometheus-dp-rate
  namespace: tigera-prometheus
  labels:
    role: tigera-prometheus-rules
    prometheus: calico-node-prometheus
spec:
  groups:
    - name: calico.rules
      rules:
        - alert: DeniedPacketsRate
          expr: rate(calico_denied_packets[10s]) > 50
          labels:
            severity: critical
          annotations:
            summary: 'Instance {{$labels.instance}} - Large rate of packets denied'
            description: '{{$labels.instance}} with calico-node pod {{$labels.pod}} has been denying packets at a fast rate {{$labels.sourceIp}} by policy {{$labels.policy}}.'
```

To update this alerting rule, to say, execute the query with a range of
20 seconds modify the manifest to this:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: calico-prometheus-dp-rate
  namespace: tigera-prometheus
  labels:
    role: tigera-prometheus-rules
    prometheus: calico-node-prometheus
spec:
  groups:
    - name: calico.rules
      rules:
        - alert: DeniedPacketsRate
          expr: rate(calico_denied_packets[20s]) > 50
          labels:
            severity: critical
          annotations:
            summary: 'Instance {{$labels.instance}} - Large rate of packets denied'
            description: '{{$labels.instance}} with calico-node pod {{$labels.pod}} has been denying packets at a fast rate {{$labels.sourceIp}} by policy {{$labels.policy}}.'
```

## Creating a New Alerting Rule

Creating a new alerting rule is straightforward once you figure out what you
want your rule to look for. Check [alerting rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/)
and [Queries](https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/examples/) for more
information.

### New Alerting Rule for Monitoring Calico Node

To add the new alerting rule to our Prometheus instance, define a PrometheusRule manifest
in the `tigera-prometheus` namespace with the labels
`role: tigera-prometheus-rules` and `prometheus: calico-node-prometheus`. The
labels should match the labels defined by the `ruleSelector` field of the
Prometheus manifest.

As an example, to fire a alert when a $[noderunning] instance has been down for
more than 5 minutes, save the following to a file, say `calico-node-down-alert.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: calico-prometheus-calico-node-down
  namespace: tigera-prometheus
  labels:
    role: tigera-prometheus-rules
    prometheus: calico-node-prometheus
spec:
  groups:
    - name: calico.rules
      rules:
        - alert: CalicoNodeInstanceDown
          expr: up == 0
          for: 5m
          labels:
            severity: warning
          annotations:
            summary: 'Instance {{$labels.instance}} Pod: {{$labels.pod}} is down'
            description: '{{$labels.instance}} of job {{$labels.job}} has been down for more than 5 minutes'
```

Then create/apply this manifest in kubernetes.

```bash
kubectl apply -f calico-node-down-alert.yaml
```

Your changes should be applied in a few seconds by the prometheus-config-reloader
container inside the prometheus pod launched by the prometheus-operator
(usually named `prometheus-<your-prometheus-instance-name>`).

### New Alerting Rule for Monitoring BGP Peers

Let’s look at an example of a new alerting rule to our Prometheus instance with respect to monitoring BGP
peering health. Define a PrometheusRule manifest in the tigera-prometheus namespace with the labels
`role: tigera-prometheus-rules` and `prometheus: calico-node-prometheus`. The labels should match the labels
defined by the `ruleSelector` field of the Prometheus manifest.

As an example, to fire an alert when the number of peering connections with a status other than “Established”
is increasing at a non-zero rate in the cluster (over the last 5 minutes), save the following to a file, say
`tigera-peer-status-not-established.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  labels:
    prometheus: calico-node-prometheus
    role: tigera-prometheus-rules
  name: tigera-prometheus-peer-status-not-established
  namespace: tigera-prometheus
spec:
  groups:
    - name: calico.rules
      rules:
        - alert: CalicoNodePeerStatusNotEstablished
          annotations:
            description: '{{$labels.instance}} has at least one peer connection that is
              no longer up.'
            summary: Instance {{$labels.instance}} has peer connection that is no longer
              up
          expr: rate(bgp_peers{status!~"Established"}[5m]) > 0
          labels:
            severity: critical
```

Then create/apply this manifest in kubernetes.

```bash
kubectl apply -f tigera-peer-status-not-established.yaml
```

Your changes should be applied in a few seconds by the prometheus-config-reloader
container inside the prometheus pod launched by the prometheus-operator
(usually named `prometheus-<your-prometheus-instance-name>`).

## Additional Alerting Rules

The Alerting Rules installed by the $[prodname] install manifest is a simple
one that fires an alert when the rate of denied packets denied by a policy on
a node from a particular Source IP exceeds a certain packets per second
threshold. The Prometheus query used for this (ignoring the threshold value 20) is:

```
rate(calico_denied_packets[10s])
```

and this query will return results something along the lines of:

```
{endpoint="calico-metrics-port",instance="10.240.0.81:9081",job="calico-node-metrics",namespace="kube-system",pod="calico-node-hn0kl",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny",service="calico-node-metrics",srcIP="192.168.167.129"}	0.6
{endpoint="calico-metrics-port",instance="10.240.0.84:9081",job="calico-node-metrics",namespace="kube-system",pod="calico-node-97m3g",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny",service="calico-node-metrics",srcIP="192.168.167.175"}	0.2
{endpoint="calico-metrics-port",instance="10.240.0.84:9081",job="calico-node-metrics",namespace="kube-system",pod="calico-node-97m3g",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny",service="calico-node-metrics",srcIP="192.168.252.157"}	0.4
{endpoint="calico-metrics-port",instance="10.240.0.81:9081",job="calico-node-metrics",namespace="kube-system",pod="calico-node-hn0kl",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny",service="calico-node-metrics",srcIP="192.168.167.175"}	1
{endpoint="calico-metrics-port",instance="10.240.0.84:9081",job="calico-node-metrics",namespace="kube-system",pod="calico-node-97m3g",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny",service="calico-node-metrics",srcIP="192.168.167.129"}	0.4
{endpoint="calico-metrics-port",instance="10.240.0.81:9081",job="calico-node-metrics",namespace="kube-system",pod="calico-node-hn0kl",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny",service="calico-node-metrics",srcIP="192.168.167.159"}	0.4
{endpoint="calico-metrics-port",instance="10.240.0.81:9081",job="calico-node-metrics",namespace="kube-system",pod="calico-node-hn0kl",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny",service="calico-node-metrics",srcIP="192.168.252.175"}	0.4
{endpoint="calico-metrics-port",instance="10.240.0.84:9081",job="calico-node-metrics",namespace="kube-system",pod="calico-node-97m3g",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny",service="calico-node-metrics",srcIP="192.168.252.175"}	0.6
{endpoint="calico-metrics-port",instance="10.240.0.81:9081",job="calico-node-metrics",namespace="kube-system",pod="calico-node-hn0kl",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny",service="calico-node-metrics",srcIP="192.168.252.157"}	0.6
{endpoint="calico-metrics-port",instance="10.240.0.84:9081",job="calico-node-metrics",namespace="kube-system",pod="calico-node-97m3g",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny",service="calico-node-metrics",srcIP="192.168.167.159"}	0.6
```

We can modify this query to find out all packets dropped by different policies
on every node.

```
(sum by (instance,policy) (rate(calico_denied_packets[10s])))
```

This query will aggregate the results from all different Source IPs, and
preserve the `policy` and `instance` labels. Note that the `instance` label
represents the calico node's IP Address and `PrometheusReporterPort`. This
query will return results like so:

```
{instance="10.240.0.84:9081",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny"}	2
{instance="10.240.0.81:9081",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny"}	2.8
```

To include the pod name in these results, add the label `pod` to the labels
listed in the `by` expression like so:

```
(sum by (instance,pod,policy) (rate(calico_denied_packets[10s])))
```

which will return the following results:

```
{instance="10.240.0.84:9081",pod="calico-node-97m3g",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny"}	2
{instance="10.240.0.81:9081",pod="calico-node-hn0kl",policy="profile/k8s_ns.test/0/deny"}	2.8
```

An interesting use case is when a rogue Pod is using tools such as nmap to
scan a subnet for open ports. To do this, we have to execute a query that will
aggregate across all policies on all instances while preserving the source IP
address. This can be done using this query:

```
(sum by (srcIP) (rate(calico_denied_packets[10s])))
```

which will return results, different source IP address:

```
{srcIP="192.168.167.159"}	1.0000000000000002
{srcIP="192.168.167.129"}	1.2000000000000002
{srcIP="192.168.252.175"}	1.4000000000000001
{srcIP="192.168.167.175"}	0.4
{srcIP="192.168.252.157"}	1.0000000000000002
```

To use these queries as Alerting Rules, follow the instructions defined in the
[Creating a new Alerting Rule](#creating-a-new-alerting-rule) section and create
a ConfigMap with the appropriate query.

## Updating the scrape interval

You may wish to modify the scrape interval (time between Prometheus polling each node for new denied packet information).
Increasing the interval reduces load on Prometheus and the amount of storage required, but decreases the detail of the collected metrics.

The scrape interval of endpoints ($[noderunning] in our case) is defined as part of
the ServiceMonitor manifest. To change the interval:

- Save the current ServiceMonitor manifest:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n tigera-prometheus get servicemonitor calico-node-monitor -o yaml > calico-node-monitor.yaml
  ```

- Update the `interval` field under `endpoints` to desired settings and
  apply the updated manifest.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f calico-node-monitor.yaml
  ```

Your changes should be applied in a few seconds by the prometheus-config-reloader
container inside the prometheus pod launched by the prometheus-operator
(usually named `prometheus-<your-prometheus-instance-name>`).

As an example on what to update, the interval in this ServiceMonitor manifest
is 5 seconds (`5s`).

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: calico-node-monitor
  namespace: tigera-prometheus
  labels:
    team: network-operators
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: calico-node
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - kube-system
  endpoints:
    - port: calico-metrics-port
      interval: 5s
```

To update $[prodname] Prometheus' scrape interval to 10 seconds modify the manifest
to this:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: calico-node-monitor
  namespace: tigera-prometheus
  labels:
    team: network-operators
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: calico-node
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - kube-system
  endpoints:
    - port: calico-metrics-port
      interval: 10s
```

## Troubleshooting Config Updates

Check config reloader logs to see if they detected any recent activity.

- For prometheus run:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n tigera-prometheus logs prometheus-<your-prometheus-name> prometheus-config-reloader
  ```

- For alertmanager run:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n tigera-prometheus logs alertmanager-<your-prometheus-name> config-reloader
  ```

The config-reloaders watch each pods file-system for updated config from
ConfigMap's or Secret's and will perform steps necessary for reloading
the configuration.
