# Connect a cluster to Calico Cloud Free

Securely connect your cluster to Calico Cloud Free to access centralized network observability for your Kubernetes deployment.

## Prerequisites

* You have `kubectl` access to a Kubernetes cluster that meets the following requirements:
  * Calico Open Source 3.30 or later on your cluster.
  * If you upgraded from an earlier version of Calico Open Source, you [enabled the `Goldmane` custom resource](#).
  * Calico Open Source was installed using the operator method.
    Manifest- and Helm-based installations are not supported.
* You have an active Calico Cloud Free account.
  To create an account, go to the [Calico Cloud Free sign-up page](https://calicocloud.io).
* You are signed in to the $[prodname] web console.
* If you're working in a restricted network environment, you are able to create allow rules for egress traffic TCP to the Calico Cloud management plane.

## Connect your cluster

1. From the web console, click the **Connect a cluster** button on the welcome screen.
1. Follow the prompts to create a name for your cluster and copy a `kubectl` command to run in your cluster.

    <details>
     <summary>What's happening in this command?</summary>

   This command creates three resources in your cluster:
   * **A `ManagementClusterConnection` resource**.
     This resource specifies the address of the Calico Cloud management cluster.
   * **A `Secret` resource (`tigera-managed-cluster-connection`)**.
     This resource provides certificates for secure communication between your cluster and the Calico Cloud management cluster.
   * **A `Secret` resource (`tigera-voltron-linseed-certs-public`)**.
     This resource provides certificates for secure communications for the specific components that Calico Cloud uses for log data and observability.

   ```bash title='Example of generated kubectl command to connect a cluster to Calico Cloud Free'
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   # Once applied to your managed cluster, a deployment is created to establish a secure tcp connection
   # with the management cluster.

   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: ManagementClusterConnection
   metadata:
   name: tigera-secure
   spec:
   # ManagementClusterAddr should be the externally reachable address to which your managed cluster
   # will connect. Valid examples are: "0.0.0.0:31000", "example.com:32000", "[::1]:32500"
   managementClusterAddr: "oss-ui-01-management.calicocloud.io:443"

   ---

   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
   name: tigera-managed-cluster-connection
   namespace: tigera-operator
   type: Opaque
   data:
   # This is the certificate of the management cluster side of the tunnel.
   management-cluster.crt: ...
   # The certificate and private key that are created and signed by the CA in the management cluster.
   managed-cluster.crt: ...
   managed-cluster.key: ...

   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
   name: tigera-voltron-linseed-certs-public
   namespace: tigera-operator
   type: Opaque
   data:
   tls.crt: ...

   EOF
   ```
   </details>

1. To start the connection process, run the `kubectl` command in your terminal.

   ```bash title='Sample output'
   managementclusterconnection.operator.tigera.io/tigera-secure created
   secret/tigera-managed-cluster-connection created
   secret/tigera-voltron-linseed-certs-public created
   ```

1. After your run the command, click **I applied the manifest** to continue.

## Verify your connection

* From the web console, click **Managed clusters** to view a list of managed clusters.
  If your cluster connected successfully, you'll see its connection status is **Connected**.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection status remains **Disconnected**

#### Your network environment restricts egress traffic to the Calico Cloud management cluster

If your network environment restricts egress traffic to the Calico Cloud management cluster, you need to create allow rules so your cluster can connect.

You can find the address of the Calico Cloud management cluster in the `ManagementClusterAddr` field of the `ManagementClusterConnection` resource:

```bash
kubectl get managementclusterconnection tigera-secure -o jsonpath='{.spec.managementClusterAddr}'
```

You'll see something like this:

```bash title='Sample output'
oss-ui-01-management.calicocloud.io:443
```

Make sure your network allows TCP egress traffic to this address.
