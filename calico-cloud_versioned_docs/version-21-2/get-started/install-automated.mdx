# Install Calico Cloud as part of an automated workflow

You can connect clusters to Calico Cloud as part of an automated workflow, using persistent client credentials and customized Helm charts.

## Prerequisites

* You have an paid Calico Cloud account.
* You are signed in to the web console as a user with the **Owner** or **Admin**, role.
* You have at least one cluster that meets our [system requirements](system-requirements.mdx).
* You have kubectl access to the cluster.
* You have installed Helm 3.0 or later on your workstation.

## Create client credentials

Create client credentials and generate a Kubernetes secret to use for automated Helm installations.

1. Select the user icon <IconUser width="20"/>**> Settings**.
1. Under the **Client Credentials** tab, click **Add Client Credential**
1. In the **Add Client Credential** dialog, enter a name and click **Create**.
   Your new client credential will appear in the list on the **Manage Client Credentials** page.
1. Locate the newly created client credential in the list and select **Action** > **Manage keys** > **Add Key**
1. Enter a name, choose how long the key will be valid, and click **Create key**.
1. Click **Download** to download the `<key-name>.yaml` secret file and store it in a secure location.
   You will not be able to retrieve this secret again.

:::important

To ensure that you always have a valid key, you should transition to a second key before the first key expires.
Create a second key, download the secret, and then replace copies of the secret file for the first key with the secret file for the second key.
When all the secrets from the first key have been replaced, you can safely delete the first key from the **Client Credentials** page.
When the key is deleted, all API requests based on that key will be rejected.

## About customizing your Helm installation

You can customize your Calico Cloud installation for the following purposes:

* to enable or disable certain features
* to modify pod scheduling and resource management

To do this, you can either edit the default `values.yaml` file or pass individual key-value pairs using the `--set` flag for the `helm upgrade` command.

### Required parameters

The following paramaters are required for all Calico Cloud installations.

| Parameter | Value | Example | Description |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `installer.clusterName` | string | `cluster-name` | The name given to your managed cluster in Calico Cloud. |
| `installer.calicoCloudVersion` | string | `$[cloudUserVersion]` | The version of Calico Cloud you're installing. |


```yaml title="Example from values.yaml with clusterName and calicoCloudVersion"
installer:
  clusterName: example-cluster
  calicoCloudVersion: $[cloudUserVersion]
```

### Optional parameters for private registries

If you're using a private registry, you must set the following parameters.

| Parameter | Value | Example | Description |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `installer.registry` | string | `my.registry/` | The name of your private registry. |
| `installer.imagePath` | string | `path/to/directory` | The path to a directory in your private registry that contains images required to install Calico Cloud. |
| `imagePullSecrets.name` | string | `secret-name` | The name of the image pull secret you will use to allow access from the `calico-cloud` namespace to your private registry. |

### Optional parameters for features

The following parameters enable certain features in Calico Cloud.
These features can be enabled or disabled only by setting them in your `values.yaml` file at installation.

| Feature name | Parameter | Values |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Packet Capture | `installer.components.packetCaptureAPI.state` |  `Enabled`, `Disabled` (default) |
| Compliance Reports | `installer.components.compliance.enabled` | `true`, `false` (default) |

:::note

If you're upgrading from Calico Cloud 19, the Packet Capture features will remain enabled unless you explicitly set them to `Disabled`.

:::

<details>
  <summary>Use alternate feature keys for legacy features</summary>

  The Image Assurance and Container Threat Detection features were removed for new users in Calico Cloud 21.1.0.
  Legacy users of those features can continue to use a deprecated version until the features are completely removed in a future release.


  | Feature | Key | Values |
  |---------|-----|--------|
  | Image Assurance | `installer.components.imageAssurance.state` | `Enabled`, `Disabled` (default) |
  | Container Threat Detection | `installer.components.runtimeSecurity.state` | `Enabled`, `Disabled` (default\*) <br/> * The default for new clusters is `Disabled`. For upgrades for previously connected clusters, the default will retain the previous state. |
  | Packet Capture | `installer.components.packetCaptureAPI.state` |  `Enabled`, `Disabled` (default\*) <br/> * The default for new clusters is `Disabled`. For upgrades for previously connected clusters, the default will retain the previous state. |
  | Compliance Reports | `installer.components.compliance.enabled` | `true`, `false` (default) |

  :::note

  If you're upgrading from Calico Cloud 19, the Container Threat Detection and Packet Capture features will remain enabled unless you explicitly set them to `Disabled`.

### Optional parameters for pod scheduling and resource management

For many Calico Cloud components, you can specify node selectors, tolerations, and resource requests and limits.
The full list of Calico Cloud components is available in the default `values.yaml` file.

:::note
Helm may overwrite previous customizations of custom resource fields available under the `installer.components` Helm parameter.
For `installer.components`, you should define all your `values.yaml` customizations to be sure nothing is lost during Calico Cloud upgrades and reinstalls.
:::

## Prepare your values.yaml with customizations

***Prerequisites***
* You reviewed the information about available customizations in [About customizing your Helm installation](#about-customizing-your-helm-installation).
* If you're installing from a private registry, you [added the Calico Cloud images to a private registry](setup-private-registry.mdx), and you have the following information about the registry:
  * Registry secret name
    :::note
    If your private registry requires credentials, create a `calico-cloud` namespace on your cluster.
    Then, create an image pull secret and use this name for the **Registry Secret Name**.
    :::
  * Image registry
  * Image path

1. Add the Calico Cloud Helm repository to your local client:

   ```bash
   helm repo add calico-cloud https://installer.calicocloud.io/charts --force-update
   ```

1. Save the default values definitions to your workstation so you can edit them locally:
   ```bash
   helm show values calico-cloud/calico-cloud > <custom-values>.yaml
   ```
   All editable values are provided in the default values definitions.

1. Add values for the required parameters, `install.clusterName` and `install.calicoCloudVersion`.

   ```yaml title="Example from values.yaml file with clusterName and calicoCloudVersion"
   installer:
     clusterName: example-cluster
     calicoCloudVersion: $[cloudUserVersion]
   ```

1. Add values for the optional parameters.
   For each resource you want to edit, uncomment the object, add a value, and save.

   ```yaml title="Example from values.yaml file with compliance reports disabled"
   installer:
     components:
       compliance:
         enabled: false
   ```

## Install Calico Cloud as part of an automated workflow

You can install Calico Cloud using repeatable kubectl or Helm commands together with valid client credentials.
These commands can be added to any automated workflow.

***Prerequisites***

* You have generated a set of client credentials and you know the path to your secret.
* You have a `values.yaml` file with your customizations.

1. Add the Calico Cloud Helm repository to your local client.

   ```bash
   helm repo add calico-cloud https://installer.calicocloud.io/charts --force-update
   ```

1. Add the Calico Cloud custom resource definitions:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install calico-cloud-crds calico-cloud/calico-cloud-crds \
   --namespace calico-cloud \
   --create-namespace
   ```

1. Apply the client credentials secret to your cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <key-name.yaml>
   ```

   :::important
   You should keep track of this with a secret management system.
   :::

1. Apply the Calico Cloud installer custom resource with your customizations in the `values.yaml` file.

   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install calico-cloud calico-cloud/calico-cloud \
   --namespace calico-cloud \
   -f <custom-values>.yaml
   ```
