# View scanned and running images

The Images Assurance board in the web console provides lists for scanned images and running images.

In the left navbar in the web console, click **Image Assurance**, **All Scanned Images**.

## All Scanned Images tab

This tab lists scanned images if you have enabled or used one of the [Image Assurance scanners](./scanners/overview).
To manage your scan results, you can filter, dismiss, or delete them:
* **Filter:** Apply different combinations of filters to refine your results, making it easier to focus on relevant vulnerabilities for remediation.
* **Dismiss:** Hide specific results from the scan results list. You can view a list of dismissed scan results by using the **Dismissed** filter.
* **Delete:** Permanently remove specific results from the scan results list.

## Running Images tab

The tab lists active container images *for all connected managed clusters*. It provides the CVEs associated with running pods to help you assess pod vulnerability. This tab is disabled by default.

To enable Running Images, click the **Setting** icon in the top right corner, then select **Enable Runtime View**.

:::note

If you are using the CLI scanner and your cluster does not use the default containerd socket path (`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`), you must change the path to allow the Running Images service to collect image information. To update the CRI socket path for a cluster, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl patch imageassurance default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"criSocketPath":"<path-to-cri-socket>"}}'
```
For details, see the [Image Assurance installation reference](../reference/installation/ia-api.mdx#image-assurance.operator.tigera.io/v1.ImageAssuranceSpec).

:::

Other notes:

- The columns, **Clusters** and **Running Instances**, show the number of running instances in clusters that are connected to $[prodname].
- The **Unknown** scan result filter reflects images that are not fully scanned. Because they can add noise to the table, they are disabled by default. To enable Unknown results for strategic troubleshooting, click the **Result** drop-down menu and select **Unknown**.
- In the All Scanned Images and Running Images tabs, the **Registry path** field may be blank if $[prodname] cannot access this metadata. For example, images from Docker Hub do not specify the registry in the image metadata.
- Any exceptions configured for image scanning will be applicable to Runtime View as well. 

## Image assessment: Pass, Warn, and Fail

The Image Assurance image assessment is based on the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3 (CVSS Scores)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator). The following table shows how Image Assurance scores map to CVSS scores.

| CVSS v3 scores                              | Image Assurance mapping | Default settings     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0.0 – (None)<br />0.1 – 3.9 (Low)           | Pass = 3.9              | Low                  |
| 4.0 – 6.9 (Medium)                          | Warn = 7                | Medium severity – 7  |
| 7.0 – 8.9 (High)<br />9.0 – 10.0 (Critical) | Fail = 8.0              | Critical or high – 8 |

CVEs without a CVSS v3 score (too old to have one, or are too new to be assigned one), display a blank score in the UI, and **N/A** in the CLI.

### Changing the default CVSS threshold values

The following default threshold values will work for the majority of $[prodname] deployments. However, you may need to change the defaults because of security requirements.

To change the CVSS threshold values, note the following:

- Changes to threshold values take effect immediately and alter the scan results for images already in the system

## Exploit Data

The scanning process also attaches EPSS and known exploit data onto each image and vulnerability viewable through the UI.

An EPSS score of 0.1 - or 10% - means a vulnerability has a 10% probability that it will be exploited in the wild within the next 30 days. 
Users should use this information alongside CVSS scores to prioritize remediating vulnerabilities. For example, you may not have the time to remediate
all critical vulnerabilities, but you can use the EPSS score to help prioritize. By additionally filtering with an EPSS score of > 90% you can target 
the critical vulnerabilities that are most likely to be exploited.

Note that an EPSS score of > 10% can be considered a high number.
Information about [The EPSS Model](https://www.first.org/epss/model) can be found on the EPSS website created by [FIRST](https://www.first.org/).

Known exploits are based off of the [CISA KEV Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog), a list of 
vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild and maintained by CISA.

## Export results

From each tab, you can export data or a JSON file with image URLs. Exporting data is based on the images in the list and the current filter selections. CSV table options include:

- **Export one row per image** - export one row for each image with all associated CVEs condensed into a single column.
- **Export one row for each image and CVE ID** - export a unique image plus CVE combination for each row. For example, if an image has 10 CVEs, 10 rows are created (1 for each CVE).

:::note

Images without associated CVEs are not included in the exported data (regardless if they are included by filters).
