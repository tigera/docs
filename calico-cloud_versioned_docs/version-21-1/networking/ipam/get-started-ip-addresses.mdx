# Get started with IP address management

## Big picture

Understand how IP address management (IPAM) functions in a Kubernetes cluster using $[prodname].

## Value

Different IPAM techniques provide different feature sets. $[prodname]’s IPAM provides additional IP allocation efficiency and flexibility compared to other address management approaches.

## Concepts

### IPAM in Kubernetes

Kubernetes uses IPAM plugins to allocate and manage IP addresses assigned to pods. Different IPAM plugins provide different feature sets. $[prodname] provides its own IPAM plugin called **calico-ipam** which is designed to work well with $[prodname] and includes a number of features.

### $[prodname] IPAM

The **calico-ipam** plugin uses $[prodname]’s IP pool resource to control how IP addresses are allocated to pods within the cluster. This is the default plugin used by most $[prodname] installations.

By default, $[prodname] uses a single IP pool for the entire Kubernetes pod CIDR, but you can divide the pod CIDR into several pools. You can assign separate IP pools to particular selections of **nodes**, or to teams, users, or applications within a cluster using **namespaces**.

You can control which pools $[prodname] uses for each pod using

- node selectors
- an annotation on the pod’s namespace, or
- an annotation on the pod

$[prodname] also supports the **host-local** IPAM plugin. However, when using the host-local IPAM plugin some $[prodname] features are not available.

### $[prodname] IPAM blocks

In $[prodname] IPAM, IP pools are subdivided into blocks -- smaller chunks that are associated with a particular node in the cluster. Each node in the cluster can have one or more blocks associated with it. $[prodname] will automatically create and destroy blocks as needed as the number of nodes and pods in the cluster grows or shrinks.

Blocks allow $[prodname] to efficiently aggregate addresses assigned to pods on the same node, reducing the size of the routing table. By default $[prodname] will try to allocate IP addresses from within an associated block, creating a new block if necessary. $[prodname] can also assign addresses to pods on a node that are not within a block associated with that node. This allows for IP allocations independent of the node on which a pod is launched.

By default, $[prodname] creates blocks with room for 64 addresses (a /26), but you can control block sizes for each IP pool.

### Host-local IPAM

The host-local plugin is a simple IP address management plugin. It uses predetermined CIDRs statically allocated to each node to choose addresses for pods. Once set, the CIDR for a node cannot be modified. Pods can be assigned addresses only from within the CIDR allocated to the node.

$[prodname] can use the host-local IPAM plugin, using the **Node.Spec.PodCIDR** field in the Kubernetes API to determine the CIDR to use for each node. However, per-node, per-pod, and per-namespace IP allocation features are not available using the host-local plugin.

The host-local IPAM plugin is primarily used by other methods of routing pod traffic from one host to another. For example, it is used when installing $[prodname] for policy enforcement with flannel networking, as well as when using $[prodname] in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
