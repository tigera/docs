# Namespace isolation and access controls

In this article you will learn how to create {{prodname}} global network policies to isolate namespaces for ingress traffic.

## Isolate access

Isolating ingress traffic access can be implemented across different groups in your organization, for example:

- Business unit, development team, or project
- Deployment environment (Dev/Stage/Prod or Pre-prod/Prod)
- Control plane
- Management plane
- Compliance environment

## Create global network policies

Microsegmentation across namespaces is achieved using {{prodname}} policy labels and selectors with a **Pass** action rule. If you are unfamiliar with policy action rules, see [Tutorial - Understanding policy tiers](../../network-policy/policy-tiers/tiered-policy.mdx).

In the following example, let's assume the following:

- We created a **security tier** (recommended for your enterprise security controls like multi-tenancy)
- Two development teams (`dev1` and `dev2`), each managing two applications or microservices
- The security tier will delegate (pass) microsegementation controls to the application tier
- We will use a GlobalNetworkPolicy with cluster wide scope that applies to pods in all namespaces in the cluster.

For example:

![multi-tenancy-ingress](/img/calico-cloud/multi-tenancy-ingress.png)

**GlobalNetworkPolicy 1**

The following policy is for ingress traffic that goes through a trusted load balancer. It resides in the security tier, and uses the **Pass** action rule to delegate control to the application tier for the `dev1` tenant. Because the application tier contains endpoints that apply, traffic is processed.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: security.ingress-dev1
spec:
  tier: security
  order: 200
  selector: tenant == "dev1"
  ingress:
    - action: Pass
      source:
        selector: trusted-ep == "load-balancer"
    - action: Pass
      source:
        selector: tenant == "dev1"
  types:
    - Ingress
```

**GlobalNetworkPolicy 2**

Similarly, we create a second GlobalNetworkPolicy for `dev2` tenant that delegates control to the application tier for the `dev2` applications.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: security.ingress-dev2
spec:
  tier: security
  order: 300
  selector: tenant == "dev2"
  ingress:
    - action: Pass
      source:
        selector: trusted-ep == "load-balancer"
    - action: Pass
      source:
        selector: tenant == "dev2"
  types:
    - Ingress
```

## Summary and recommendations

In these examples, we implemented ingress access controls for two development teams. The global network policy has cluster-wide scope (applying to pods in all namespaces in the cluster). For **egress controls**, we recommend the following:

- Use permissive egress policies for intra-cluster communication
- Implement [Global default deny](default-deny.mdx) security controls
- Implement [Global egress access controls](global-egress.mdx) for communication with endpoints external to the cluster in the security tier. These controls govern the communication of all applications for a given tenant with the outside world.
