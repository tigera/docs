# Understand scan results in Manager UI

In the left navbar in Manager UI, click **Image Assurance**, **Scan Results**.

**Scan Results tab**

The left panel lists scanned images (assuming you set up the CLI scanner to report scan results to {{prodname}}).

The right pane lists:

- Number of images grouped by Fail, Warn, Pass, and Unknown (the CLI scanner has not yet reported results)
- High Risk Repos (top five repos based on total Fails)
- Image details (when you have an image selected from the left panel list) lists associated CVEs, if any
    - For each CVE listed, you can view the details of the vulnerability or add an exception to ignore the vulnerability (see [Create vulnerability exceptions](#create-vulnerability-exceptions)). 

**Runtime tab**

The left panel lists images running in your cluster. Because you can see the CVEs associated with running pods, you can assess pod vulnerability. The columns, **Clusters** and **Running Instances**, show the number of running instances in clusters that are connected to {{prodname}}.

The right panel lists:

- Number of running pods that have images with scan results of Fail, Warn, Pass, and Unknown (the CLI scanner has not yet reported results)
- High Risk Namespaces (top five namespaces based on total Fails)
- Runtime details (when you have an image selected from the left panel list) shows the clusters and namespaces the selected image is running in

:::note

In the Scan Results and Runtime tabs, the **Registry path** field may be blank if {{prodname}} cannot access this metadata. For example, images from Docker Hub do not specify the registry in the image metadata.

**How Pass, Warn, and Fail scores map to CVSS scores**

{{prodname}} image scoring is based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3 (CVSS Scores).
You can change the CVSS score threshold between a Pass and a Warn, and between a Warn and a Fail. Currently, only [CVSS v3 scores](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) are displayed. CVEs that do not have a CVSS v3 score (too old to have one, or are too new to be assigned one), display a blank score in the UI, and **N/A** in the CLI.

| CVSS v3 scores                              | Image Assurance mapping | Default settings     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0.0 – (None)<br />0.1 – 3.9 (Low)           | Pass = 3.9              | Low                  |
| 4.0 – 6.9 (Medium)                          | Warn = 7                | Medium severity – 7  |
| 7.0 – 8.9 (High)<br />9.0 – 10.0 (Critical) | Fail = 8.0              | Critical or high – 8 |

**Changing the default CVSS threshold values**

The default threshold values (shown below) will work for the majority of {{prodname}} deployments. However, you may need to change the defaults because of security requirements.

![scan-settings](/img/calico-cloud/scan-settings.png)

To change the CVSS threshold values, note the following:

- Changes to threshold values take effect immediately and alter the scan results for images already in the system
- If you are using admission controller policies, changing a value may allow pods in your Kubernetes cluster that were previously being blocked, to now be deployed or vice versa.

**Enable Runtime View**

You can configure your scan settings to directly monitor pods that are running in your Kubernetes clusters.
When enabled, Runtime View checks image information from the active container images in all of your connected clusters.
These images are correlated with the images you have recorded in the Image Assurance system.

To enable Runtime View, select the **Enable Runtime View** checkbox in the **Scan Results** tab.
You can clear the checkbox to disable Runtime View.
After disabling Runtime View, some runtime information for existing images will remain in the system.

:::note

If your cluster does not use the default containerd socket path (`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`), then you must change the path to allow the Runtime View service to collect image information.

To update the CRI socket path for a cluster, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl patch imageassurance default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"criSocketPath":"<path-to-cri-socket>"}}'
```
See [the installation reference](../reference/installation/api.mdx#image-assurance.operator.tigera.io/v1.ImageAssuranceSpec) for more details on the ImageAssurance CR.

### Exclude specific vulnerabilities

In some cases, you may want to exclude specific vulnerabilities from your scan results. For example, you may determine that a warning is a false positive because of the way you are using an affected package. By creating a vulnerability exception, you can configure Image Assurance to ignore a CVE for a specific image, all images from the same repo, or for all images.

:::caution 
A vulnerability exception can significantly change how Image Assurance determines image health. 
- **Maximum CVSS score** 
An image’s maximum CVSS score may be reduced to a lower score. An exception could eliminate the vulnerability with the highest CVSS score for an image. 
- **Scan results** 
Scan results for Pass/Warn/Fail could change because they are based on the maximum CVSS score. For example, Fail could change to Warn, and Warn could change to Pass. 
- **Vulnerability global alerts** 
Alerts may no longer be triggered. Alerts are triggered based on scan results or maximum CVSS score values of images. 
- **Admission controller** 
Pods could be created where they were previously blocked. Admission controller policies are based on vulnerability information (scan result and/or maximum CVSS score). 
:::

1. Go to **Image Assurance** > **Scan Results**. 
2. Select an image from the list. On the **Scan Results** page for that image, find the CVE, and click **Actions** > **Add Exception**. 
3. From the **Add Exception** dialog, select a scope, add a description, and click **Save**. The new vulnerability exception is immediately applied to your scan results.

To view your existing vulnerability exceptions, navigate to the Exceptions page, by going to **Image Assurance** > **Vulnerability Exceptions**.

### Export scan results

To export the scan results for images you have scanned and uploaded to Image Assurance:

On the Scan Results or Runtime tab of the Manager UI, click **Export**.

The export generates a CSV file with image and CVE metadata for the current list of images you have selected (based on your current filter options). Options include:

- **Export one row for each image and CVE ID** exports a unique image + CVE combination for each row. For example, if an image has 10 CVEs, 10 rows are created (1 for each CVE).
- **Export one row per image** exports one row for each image, with all associated CVEs condensed into a single column.
- **Export for scanning** exports a JSON file that contains image URLs which can be used as an input to the scanner.

:::note

Images with no associated CVEs are not included in the exported data (regardless of whether or not it is included by the filters).
