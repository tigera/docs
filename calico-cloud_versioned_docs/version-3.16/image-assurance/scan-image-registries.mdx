# Scan images for vulnerabilities

## Big picture

Scan images for vulnerabilities using {{prodname}} Image Assurance.

## Value

{{prodname}} Image Assurances helps you identify vulnerabilities in workloads that you deploy to Kubernetes clusters. A vulnerability can be a weakness in an application (for example, a design flaw or an implementation bug) that allows attackers to cause additional harm. With Image Assurance you can:

- Scan an image for vulnerabilities
- Assess the impact of newly-found vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts
- Create exceptions to ignore specific vulnerabilities
- Create alerts on high-severity vulnerabilities so you can delegate remediation efforts to the appropriate team
- Block non-compliant workloads using policy as part of your cloud-native security posture

## About Image Assurance

Image Assurance is based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system, which provides a catalog of publicly-known security vulnerabilities and exposures. Known vulnerabilities are identified by a unique CVE ID based on the year it was reported (for example, CVE-2021-44228).

Image Assurance provides a command-line interface (CLI) to scan images, with the option to send results to the Manager UI. Scanned image content includes:

- Libraries and content (for example, python, ruby gems, jars and go)
- Packages (OS and non-OS)
- Image layer

## Before you begin

**Update your cluster**

Update your cluster to get the latest version of Image Assurance:

1. Navigate to the **Managed Clusters** page.
1. Select the cluster from the list, and click **Reinstall**.
1. Copy the updated install script command and run it against your cluster.

**Image requirements**

To be included in scan results, images must:

- Be available locally through the container runtime environment where the CLI scanner is running
- Have a RepoDigest ID

  To verify RepoDigestIDs, run this command:

  `docker images --digests`

**CLI scanner requirements**

- Must have internet access to download and update the vulnerability database
- To see image scan results in Manager UI, the CLI scanner must communicate with an external API endpoint outside your environment

## How to

- [Start the CLI scanner](#start-the-cli-scanner)
- [Scan images using CLI](#scan-images-using-cli)
- [Scan images using a config file](#scan-images-using-a-config-file)
- [Understand scan results in Manager UI](#understand-scan-results-in-manager-ui)
- [Create vulnerability exceptions](#create-vulnerability-exceptions)
- [Export scan results](#export-scan-results)

### Start the CLI scanner

1. Download the latest version of the CLI scanner.

   **Linux**

   ```shell
   curl -Lo tigera-scanner {{clouddownloadbase}}/tigera-scanner/{{cloudversion}}/image-assurance-scanner-cli-linux-amd64
   ```

   **MacOS**

   ```shell
   curl -Lo tigera-scanner {{clouddownloadbase}}/tigera-scanner/{{cloudversion}}/image-assurance-scanner-cli-darwin-amd64
   ```

2. Set the executable flag on the binary.

   ```shell
   chmod +x ./tigera-scanner
   ```

   :::note

   You must download and set the executable flag each time you get a new version of the CLI.

   :::

3. Verify the CLI scanner works correctly by running the version command.

   ```shell
   ./tigera-scanner version
   {{imageassuranceversion}}
   ```

### Scan images using CLI

You can scan images and report results back to {{prodname}}, or scan images locally without reporting results to {{prodname}}.

**Syntax**:

`tigera-scanner scan [OPTIONS] <image_name>`

**Options**:

- `--apiurl` - {{prodname}} API URL path. You can get this URL in Manager UI, **Image Assurance**, **Scan settings**.
- `--token` - secure API or authorization token to make requests to {{prodname}} API URL. You can get this URL in Manager UI, **Image Assurance**, **Scan settings**.
- `--warn_threshold` - CVSS threshold for Warn scan results. Range from 0.0 - 10.0.
- `--fail_threshold` - CVSS threshold for Fail scan results. Range from 0.0 - 10.0.
- `--vulnerability_db_path` - path to a folder to store vulnerability data (defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`; if it is not set, defaults to `$HOME/.cache`).
- `--input_file <file-path>` - Path to a JSON file containing image URLs.
- `--output_file <file-path>` - File path that will contain scan results in a JSON format.

**Examples**

**Scan an image, report results**

```shell
./tigera-scanner scan ubuntu:latest --apiurl https://<my-org>.calicocloud.io --token ezBhbGcetc...
```

**Scan an image locally, do not report results**

```shell
./tigera-scanner scan ubuntu:latest
```

**Scan an image with a failure and warning threshold**

```shell
./tigera-scanner scan ubuntu:latest --fail_threshold 7.0 --warn_threshold 3.9
```

**Scan multiple images locally, do not report results**

```shell
./tigera-scanner scan ubuntu:latest alpine:latest
```

**Scan multiple images using an input and output file**

The input file must have the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "images": [
    "ubuntu:latest",
    "alpine:latest"
  ]
}
```

```shell
./tigera-scanner scan --input_file images.json --output_file results.json
```

### Scan images using a config file

Create a configuration file in `$HOME/.tigera-scanner.yaml` for the CLI to read.

:::note

Key names must match the full name of arguments passed to the CLI. The configuration precedence order is options > environment variables > file configuration.

### Update the CLI scanner

To get the latest updates, you'll need to update the CLI scanner binary. To see the current version you are running, run this command:

```shell
./tigera-scanner version
{{imageassuranceversion}}
```

To see the latest version, see [Release notes](../release-notes/index.mdx).

To download the latest version, see [Start the CLI scanner](#start-the-cli-scanner).

### Understand scan results in Manager UI

In the left navbar in Manager UI, click **Image Assurance**, **Scan Results**.

**Scan Results tab**

The left panel lists scanned images (assuming you set up the CLI scanner to report scan results to {{prodname}}).

The right pane lists:

- Number of images grouped by Fail, Warn, Pass, and Unknown (the CLI scanner has not yet reported results)
- High Risk Repos (top five repos based on total Fails)

**Runtime tab**

The left panel lists images running in your cluster. Because you can see the CVEs associated with running pods, you can assess pod vulnerability. The columns, **Clusters** and **Running Instances**, show the number of running instances in clusters that are connected to {{prodname}}.

The right panel lists:

- Number of running pods that have images with scan results of Fail, Warn, Pass, and Unknown (the CLI scanner has not yet reported results)
- High Risk Namespaces (top five namespaces based on total Fails)

:::note

In the Scan Results and Runtime tabs, the **Registry path** field may be blank if {{prodname}} cannot access this metadata. For example, images from Docker Hub do not specify the registry in the image metadata.

:::

**How Pass, Warn, and Fail scores map to CVSS scores**

{{prodname}} image scoring is based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3 (CVSS Scores).
You can change the CVSS score threshold between a Pass and a Warn, and between a Warn and a Fail. Currently, only [CVSS v3 scores](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) are displayed. CVEs that do not have a CVSS v3 score (too old to have one, or are too new to be assigned one), display a blank score in the UI, and **N/A** in the CLI.

| CVSS v3 scores                              | Image Assurance mapping | Default settings     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0.0 – (None)<br />0.1 – 3.9 (Low)           | Pass = 3.9              | Low                  |
| 4.0 – 6.9 (Medium)                          | Warn = 7                | Medium severity – 7  |
| 7.0 – 8.9 (High)<br />9.0 – 10.0 (Critical) | Fail = 8.0              | Critical or high – 8 |

**Changing the default CVSS threshold values**

The default threshold values (shown below) will work for the majority of {{prodname}} deployments. However, you may need to change the defaults because of security requirements.

![scan-settings](/img/calico-cloud/scan-settings.png)

To change the CVSS threshold values, note the following:

- Changes to threshold values take effect immediately and alter the scan results for images already in the system
- If you are using admission controller policies, changing a value may allow pods in your Kubernetes cluster that were previously being blocked, to now be deployed or vice versa.

**Enable Runtime View**

When Runtime View is enabled in Scan Settings, {{prodname}} actively monitors pods running in your Kubernetes clusters so it can correlate them with images you have recorded in the Image Assurance system. By default, this feature is disabled. If you disable the feature after it has been enabled, runtime information that is already collected for existing images will remain in the system.

### Create vulnerability exceptions

In some cases, you may want to ignore specific vulnerabilities or CVEs. For example:

- You determine scan results are "false positives" (based on how you are using the affected package)
- You decide to exclude a vulnerability based on your own internal assessment

To exclude a vulnerability from scanning results, create a vulnerability exception.

In the left navbar in Manager, click **Image Assurance**, **Vulnerability Exceptions**.

Before creating an exception, it is important to understand the effects to Image Assurance.

- **Maximum CVSS score**

  An image’s maximum CVSS score may be reduced to a lower score. An exception could eliminate the vulnerability with the highest CVSS score for an image.

- **Scan results**

  Scan results for Pass/Warn/Fail could change because they are based on the maximum CVSS score. For example, Fail could change to Warn, and Warn could change to Pass.

- **Vulnerability global alerts**

  Alerts may no longer be generated. Alerts are triggered based on scan results or maximum CVSS score values of images.

- **Admission controller**

  Pods could be created where they were previously blocked. Admission controller policies are based on vulnerability information (scan result and/or maximum CVSS score).

### Export scan results

To export the scan results for images you have scanned and uploaded to Image Assurance:

On the Scan Results or Runtime tab of the Manager UI, click **Export**.

The export generates a CSV file with image and CVE metadata for the current list of images you have selected (based on your current filter options). Options include:

- **Export one row for each image and CVE ID** exports a unique image + CVE combination for each row. For example, if an image has 10 CVEs, 10 rows are created (1 for each CVE).
- **Export one row per image** exports one row for each image, with all associated CVEs condensed into a single column.
- **Export for scanning** exports a JSON file that contains image URLs which can be used as an input to the scanner.

:::note

Images with no associated CVEs are not included in the exported data (regardless of whether or not it is included by the filters).
