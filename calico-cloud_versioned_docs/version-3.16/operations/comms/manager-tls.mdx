# Provide TLS certificates for Calico Cloud Manager

## Big picture

Provide TLS certificates that secure access to the {{prodname}} manager user interface.

## Value

By default, the {{prodname}} manager UI uses self-signed TLS certificates on connections. This article describes how to provide TLS certificates that users' browsers will trust.

## Before you begin...

- **Get the certificate and key pair for the {{prodname}} Manager UI**
  Generate the certificate using any X.509-compatible tool or from your organization's Certificate Authority.

<!--TODO-XREFS-CC
The certificate must have Common Name or Subject Alternate Names that match the IPs or DNS names that will be used to [access the manager UI](/operations/cnx/access-the-manager/).
-->
## How to

To provide certificates for use during deployment you must create a secret before applying the 'custom-resource.yaml' or before creating the Installation resource. To specify certificates for use in the manager, create a secret using the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic manager-tls -n tigera-operator --from-file=cert=</path/to/certificate-file> --from-file=key=</path/to/key-file>
```

To update existing certificates, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic manager-tls -n tigera-operator --from-file=cert=</path/to/certificate-file> --from-file=key=</path/to/key-file> --dry-run -o yaml --save-config | kubectl replace -f -
```

If the {{prodname}} Manager UI is already running then updating the secret should cause it to restart and pickup the new certificate and key. This will result in a short period of unavailability of the {{prodname}} Manager UI.

## Additional resources

Additional documentation is available for securing [{{prodname}} manager connections](crypto-auth.mdx#calico-enterprise-manager-connections).
