# Calico Cloud Support Policy 2022

**Effective date**: February 18, 2022

This Subscription Support Policy describes the maintenance and support options that are available to customers of Calico Cloud (the “Solution”) and explains the terms and conditions under which Tigera provides support for the Solution.

For the purpose of this document, an “issue” is defined as: (i) any failure of Tigera’s Solution to function substantially in accordance with Tigera’s generally published technical documentation regarding the Solution; (ii) any material defect in the Supported Solution; or (iii) any question regarding the use and operations of the Supported Solution.

## Subscription Support from Tigera

Tigera provides a support portal (“Support Portal”) as the primary channel for customers to access our support resources including access to technical support engineers. All Issues must be reported via the Support Portal by contacts who have been authorized as the support contacts for Tigera. Issue reports must describe the Issue and include sufficient information (data, logs) for Tigera to reproduce and troubleshoot the Issue.

Customer agrees to cooperate with and assist Tigera in its troubleshooting and resolution efforts for Issues reported by the Customer. Customer also agrees to (i) enable the call home feature in the Solution and, (ii) provide remote access to the Solution for the duration required by Tigera to investigate, troubleshoot and resolve Issues. Tigera will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Subscription Support in accordance with our Service Level Guidelines listed below:

### Response SLA

| Severity Level | Description | Response Level  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Critical       | Production system is down, causing critical impact to business operations if service is not restored quickly. No work around is available. | Within 4 Hours  |
| Standard       | Any other issue that is not deemed to be critical.           | Within 16 Hours |
|                | *All verbal and written support provided by Tigera will be in English.* |                 |

Tigera shall have no obligation to resolve Issues unless Customer provides all the information and access required by Tigera.

To access and use Subscription Support, you must raise any issues via the Support Portal and provide Tigera with sufficient information to validate your entitlement to the relevant Subscription Support Level.

We do not provide Subscription Support for Solution that (a) you (or a third party) have modified or recompiled or (b) is running on a platform that is not a platform supported by Tigera. You are responsible for testing the Solution before deploying it in your environment. You should also backup your systems on a regular basis and have those backups available if needed for resolving technical issues.

Subscription Support is provided in the English language. Tigera’s standard business hours are 8am-5pm Pacific Time, Monday-Friday excluding standard public holidays.

**Third Party Access**

Customer may allow Authorized Users and Affiliates to use the Technology and access the Services solely for Customer’s business purposes, provided that Customer ensures its Authorized Users and Affiliates comply with the terms of this Agreement. Upon request, Customer will provide Tigera with details of all Users and Affiliates authorized to access the Technology.

## Exclusions

Tigera shall have no responsibility to provide Subscription Support for any issues resulting from: (i) the use or combination of the Solution with any software that is not provided by Tigera; (ii) causes external to the Solution, such as problems with any other hardware, software or other infrastructure with which the Solution is used; (iii) improper, unauthorized or negligent installation, configuration or use of the Solution (including, but not limited to, use of the Solution that is inconsistent with the sizing, use cases, design or architecture of the Solution purchased by the Customer); (iv) any alterations or modifications made to the Solution by anyone other than Tigera; (v) use of the Solution versions which are unsupported by Tigera; (vi) use of any hardware or software which is not listed in the Requirements section of our product documentation; or (vii) any other cause not within Tigera’s reasonable control.

## Customer’s Breach

Tigera shall have no obligation to provide Subscription Support to Customer in the event of a breach by Customer of any of its obligations under the Tigera Subscription Agreement or this Subscription Support Policy.

## Solution Upgrades

Tigera may, from time to time, make available to its customers new releases of the Solution. During the Subscription Support term, Customer will be entitled to receive any new releases which Tigera in its sole discretion elects to make available without additional charge to its customers with a current and valid Subscription Support entitlement, provided that the Customer has paid all fees and is not in breach of any of its obligations under the Tigera Subscription Agreement and this Subscription Support Policy. Tigera may, from time to time, introduce new software products or introduce new features for which Tigera charges a separate fee. Customer shall not be entitled to receive such software products or features without paying the associated fees.

## Support Term
