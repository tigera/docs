# Upgrade Calico Cloud

## Upgrade notices

You are required to upgrade your cluster to the latest {{prodname}} version before the cluster reaches two minor releases older than the current release. For example, if the latest {{prodname}} version is based on 3.19, managed clusters with v3.16 or older will not be covered for fixes under the [Calico Cloud Support Policy](../get-started/support-policy-2022.mdx).

Upgrade notices are provided 26 days in advance in Manager UI, **Managed clusters** page. For example:
