{{prodname}} creates a routed network on which your containers look like normal IP
speakers. You can connect to them from a host in your cluster (assuming the
network policy you've assigned allows this) using their IP address.

This document discusses connectivity between {{prodname}} endpoints and hosts outside
the cluster.

## Outbound connectivity

Outbound connectivity refers to connections originating from {{prodname}} endpoints
to destinations outside the cluster.

The easiest way to get outbound connectivity is to turn on NAT Outgoing on all
{{prodname}} pools you want to be able to access the internet.

### For each pool that needs connectivity:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="kubectl" value="kubectl-0">

```bash
kubectl patch ippool <name> --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"natOutgoing": true}}'
```

You should see an output like below:
```
ippool.projectcalico.org/<name> patched
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="calicoctl" value="calicoctl-1">

```bash
calicoctl patch ippool <name> --patch '{"spec":{"natOutgoing": true}}'
```

You should see an output like below:
```
Successfully patched 1 'IPPool' resource
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Please note that many solutions for inbound connectivity will also provide
outbound connectivity.

## Inbound connectivity

Inbound connectivity refers to connections to {{prodname}} endpoints originating from
outside the cluster.

There are two main approaches: BGP peering into your network infrastructure, or
using orchestrator specific options.

Remember to configure your network policy to allow traffic from the internet!

### BGP peering

This requires access to BGP capable switches or routers in front of your {{prodname}}
cluster.

In general, this will involve peering the nodes in your {{prodname}} cluster with BGP
capable switches, which act as the gateway to reach {{prodname}} endpoints in the
cluster from outside.

A common scenario is for your container hosts to be on their own isolated layer
2 network, like a rack in your server room or an entire data center.  Access to
that network is via a router, which also is the default router for all the
container hosts.

See the [BGP peering document](/networking/bgp)
for information on how to set up the `{{nodecontainer}}` sides of the sessions.
Consult the documentation for your BGP capable switch/router to set up the
switch sides of the sessions.

If you have a small number of hosts, you can configure BGP sessions between your router and each {{prodname}}-enabled host. With many hosts, you may wish to use a
route reflector or set up a Layer 3 topology.

There's further advice on network topologies in [{{prodname}} over Ethernet fabrics](../reference/architecture/design/l2-interconnect-fabric.mdx).
We'd also encourage you to [get in touch](https://www.projectcalico.org/contact/)
to discuss your environment.

### Orchestrator specific

{{prodname}} supports a number of orchestrator specific options for inbound
connectivity, such as Kubernetes service IPs.

Consult the [documentation for your orchestrator](../getting-started/index.mdx) for more information.
