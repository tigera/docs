Prometheus (including AlertManager) is an open-source toolkit for systems monitoring and alerting. Prometheus is the default monitoring tool for {{prodname}} component metrics and alerting.

You install the Prometheus operator and CRDs when you install {{prodname}} on your cluster. 

**What if I have my own Prometheus operator?**

If you have your own Prometheus operator, you can skip this step during {{prodname}} installation. The only requirement is that your Prometheus operator is v0.40.0 or higher. Note that {{prodname}} creates AlertManager and Prometheus CRs in the `tigera-prometheus` namespace. Make sure that your Prometheus operator is configured to manage Prometheus and AlertManager instances in the `tigera-prometheus` namespace. That's all you need to do.

**Is BYO Prometheus supported for {{prodname}}?**

- Supported for calico-node/Felix metrics
- Not supported for {{prodname}} networking and policy metrics or integration with {{prodname}} Manager.
