This page describes how to upgrade to {{page.version}} for OpenShift 4 from an existing {{prodname}} cluster.

<HostEndpointsUpgrade prodname='{{prodname}}' orch="OpenShift" />

## Upgrading Calico on OpenShift 4

Make a manifests directory.

mkdir manifests
```

<InstallOpenShiftManifests prodname='{{prodname}}' />

Apply the updated manifests.

You can now monitor the upgrade progress with the following command:

watch oc get tigerastatus
```

If you were upgrading from a version of Calico prior to v3.14 and followed the pre-upgrade steps for host endpoints above, review traffic logs from the temporary policy,
add any global network policies needed to allow traffic, and delete the temporary network policy **allow-all-upgrade**.
