While resources may be supplied in YAML or JSON format, this guide provides examples in YAML.

## Overview of resource structure

The general structure of a single resource is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: <type of resource>
metadata:
  # Identifying information
  name: <name of resource>
  ...
spec:
  # Specification of the resource
  ...
```

### Schema

| Field    | Description           | Accepted Values              | Schema |
|----------|-----------------------|------------------------------|--------|
| apiVersion     | Indicates the version of the API that the data corresponds to. | projectcalico.org/v3 | string |
| kind     | Specifies the type of resource described by the YAML document. |  | kind  |
| metadata | Contains information used to uniquely identify the particular instance of the resource. | | map |
| spec     | Contains the resource specification. | | map |


### Resource name requirements

Every resource must have the `name` field specified. Name must be unique within a namespace.
Name required when creating resources, and cannot be updated.
A valid resource name can have alphanumeric characters with optional `.`, `_`, or `-`. of up to 128 characters total.
