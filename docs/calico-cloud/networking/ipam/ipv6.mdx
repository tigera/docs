## Big picture

Configure {{prodname}} IP address allocation to use dual stack or IPv6 only for workload communications.

## Value

Workload communication over IPv6 is increasingly desirable, as well as or instead of IPv4. {{prodname}} supports:

- **IPv4 only** (default)

  Each workload gets an IPv4 address, and can communicate over IPv4.

- **Dual stack**

  Each workload gets an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, and can communicate over IPv4 or IPv6.

- **IPv6 only**

  Each workload gets an IPv6 address, and can communicate over IPv6.

## Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{prodname}} features:

- **CNI plugin configuration** with `assign_ipv6` and `assign_ipv4` flags
- **IPPool**

## Before you begin

**{{prodname}} requirements**

- {{prodname}} IPAM

**Kubernetes version requirements**
  - For dual stack, 1.16 and later
  - For one IP stack at a time (IPv4 or IPv6), any Kubernetes version

**Kubernetes IPv6 host requirements**
  - An IPv6 address that is reachable from the other hosts
  - The sysctl setting, `net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding`, is set to `1`.
    This ensures both Kubernetes service traffic and {{prodname}} traffic is forwarded appropriately.
  - A default IPv6 route

**Kubernetes IPv4 host requirements**
  - An IPv4 address that is reachable from the other hosts
  - The sysctl setting, `net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding`, is set to `1`.
    This ensures both Kubernetes service traffic and {{prodname}} traffic is forwarded appropriately.
  - A default IPv4 route

### Enable IPv6 only

-->

1. Set up a new Kubernetes cluster with an IPv6 pod CIDR and service IP range.

1. When about to apply `custom-resources.yaml`, edit it first to define an IPv6 pod CIDR
    pool in the `Installation` resource.  For example, like this:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
    kind: Installation
    metadata:
      name: default
    spec:
       Install Calico Enterprise
      variant: TigeraSecureEnterprise
      ...
      calicoNetwork:
        ipPools:
        - cidr: fd5f:1801::/112
      ...
    ```

1. Apply the edited manifest with `kubectl apply -f`.

   New pods will get IPv6 addresses, and can communicate with each other and the outside world over IPv6.

**(Optional) Update host to not look for IPv4 addresses**

If you want your workloads to have IPv6 addresses only, because you do not have IPv4 addresses or connectivity
between your nodes, complete these additional steps to tell {{prodname}} not to look for any IPv4 addresses.

1. Disable [IP autodetection of IPv4](/networking/ip-autodetection) by setting `IP` to `none`.
1. Calculate the {{prodname}} BGP router ID for IPv6 using either of the following methods.
   - Set the environment variable `CALICO_ROUTER_ID=hash` on {{nodecontainer}}.
     This configures {{prodname}} to calculate the router ID based on the hostname.
   - Pass a unique value for `CALICO_ROUTER_ID` to each node individually.

### Enable dual stack

1. Set up a new cluster following the Kubernetes [prerequisites](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/#prerequisites) and [enablement steps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/#enable-ipv4-ipv6-dual-stack).


1. When about to apply `custom-resources.yaml`, edit it first to define an IPv4 and IPv6 pod CIDR
    pool in the `Installation` resource.  For example, like this:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
    kind: Installation
    metadata:
      name: default
    spec:
       Install Calico Enterprise
      variant: TigeraSecureEnterprise
      ...
      calicoNetwork:
        ipPools:
        - cidr: 192.168.0.0/16
        - cidr: fd5f:1801::/112
      ...
    ```

1. Apply the edited manifest with `kubectl apply -f`.

   New pods will get both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and can communicate with each other and the outside world over IPv4 or IPv6.
