## About the installation wizard

You connect your cluster to {{prodname}} using an installation wizard. The wizard verifies that you have a compatible cluster and directs you to the following docs to prepare your cluster.  

- [System requirements](system-requirements.mdx)

Additional steps for these platforms:

- [AKS](aks.mdx)
- [GKE](gke.mdx)
- [RKE](rke.mdx)

If you are curious about what happens under the covers during installation, see [What happens when you connect a cluster](connect-cluster.mdx).

## Install and connect your cluster

1. From the left navbar in Manager UI, click **Managed Clusters**.
1. Click **Connect** and follow the wizard. 

## Monitor progress

You can monitor install progress and view streaming log output on the **Managed Clusters** page.
