## Prerequisites 

Cluster meets [System requirements]({{sitebase.url}}/get-started/connect/system-requirements).

## Verify settings

1. Run the following command on your AKS cluster to verify it is using the Azure CNI, with network policy disabled. 

    ```bash
    az aks show --query 'networkProfile'
    ```

    You should see `"networkPlugin": "azure"` and `"networkPolicy": null`.

1. Verify that transparent mode is being used by running one of the following commands. 

    `cat /etc/cni/net.d/*` 

    Output should contain: `"mode": "transparent"`. (There are other ways to run `cat /etc/cni/net.d/*`; just ensure that you run the command on one of the nodes in the cluster.)

    OR

    ```bash
    az vmss run-command invoke -g <resource-group> -n <vmss-name> --scripts "cat /etc/cni/net.d/*" --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --query 'value[0].message'
    ```

For help in the Azure portal, see [Azure CNI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni) in [transparent mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/faq#what-is-azure-cni-transparent-mode-vs-bridge-mode).

## Verify IAM permissions

Verify that your user account has IAM permissions to create Kubernetes ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, Deployments, Service Accounts, and Custom Resource Definitions. The easiest way to grant permissions is to assign the "Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role‚Äù to your user account. For help, see [AKS access control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/control-kubeconfig-access).
