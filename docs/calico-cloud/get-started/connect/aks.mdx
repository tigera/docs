## Prerequisites 

Your cluster meets the [system requirements]({{sitebase.url}}/get-started/connect/system-requirements).

Your cluster has a container network interface (CNI) plugin that is configured and running.

## Verify settings

1. Check that you're using a supported CNI and network policy configuration by running the following command on your AKS cluster:

    ```bash
    az aks show --query 'networkProfile'
    ```

    You must have one of the following combinations of values for`networkPlugin` and `networkPolicy`:

    * `"networkPlugin": "none"` and `"networkPolicy": null`
    * `"networkPlugin": "azure"` and `"networkPolicy": null`
    * `"networkPlugin": "azure"` and `"networkPolicy": "calico"`

1. Verify that transparent mode is being used by running one of the following commands. 

   `cat /etc/cni/net.d/*` 

    OR

    ```bash
    az vmss run-command invoke -g <resource-group> -n <vmss-name> --scripts "cat /etc/cni/net.d/*" --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --query 'value[0].message'
    ```

   If the Azure CNI is enabled, the output should include `"mode": "transparent"`.

For help in the Azure portal, see [Azure CNI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni) in [transparent mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/faq#what-is-azure-cni-transparent-mode-vs-bridge-mode).

## Verify IAM permissions

Verify that your user account has IAM permissions to create Kubernetes ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, Deployments, Service Accounts, and Custom Resource Definitions. The easiest way to grant permissions is to assign the "Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role‚Äù to your user account. For help, see [AKS access control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/control-kubeconfig-access).
