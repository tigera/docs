## Prerequisites 

Cluster meets [System requirements]({{sitebase.url}}/get-started/connect/system-requirements).

## Verify settings

{% include /content/gke-settings.md %}

## Verify IAM permissions

Verify that your user account has IAM permissions to create Kubernetes ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, Deployments, Service Accounts, and Custom Resource Definitions. The easiest way to grant permissions is to assign the "Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role‚Äù to your user account. For help, see [GKE access control](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control).
