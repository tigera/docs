Follow these steps to create a compatible cluster for installing {{prodname}}.

### Step 1: Check supported platform

**Supported Kubernetes platforms**

{{prodname}} supports all of the open-source [Kubernetes deployments](https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/kubernetes/), except: 

- MKE (formerly Docker)
- IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)
- K3s

**Supported architecture**
- Only AMD64

**Not supported**
- Clusters with Windows nodes 

### Step 2: Check supported Kubernetes version

As of this date, {{prodname}} supports the following Kubernetes versions:

- Minimum: v1.21
- Maximum: v1.23

If you have a later version than the maximum, contact [Support](https://support.tigera.io/).

### Step 3: Check supported CNI plugin

  - Calico CNI
  - Amazon VPC CNI
  - Azure CNI
  - GKE CNI

### Step 4: Verify cluster is not managed by a Kubernetes reconciler

{{prodname}} cannot be installed on clusters that are managed by any kind of Kubernetes reconciler (for example, Addon-manager). To verify, look for an annotation called `addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode` on either of the following resources. (The resources may not exist).

- `tigera-operator` deployment in the `tigera-operator` namespace (Installation on AKS will work if the mode is EnsureExists)
- `calico-node` daemonset in the `kube-system` namespace

If the following command finds addonmanager on either of the resources, then Addon-manager is being used. Find a different cluster to use. 

```bash
kubectl get <type> -n <namespace> <resource-name> -o yaml | grep ' addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode:'
```

### Step 5: Prepare your infrastructure to connect to {{prodname}}

Pods running in your kubernetes cluster should be allowed to connect to the following endpoints:

- https://installer.calicocloud.io:443/*
- https://www.calicocloud.io:443/api/*
- TCP to `<management-cluster>.calicocloud.io:9000`

Docker running on each node should be able to pull images from `quay.io`,`cdn01.quay.io`,`cdn02.quay.io`, and `us-docker.pkg.dev`

### Step 6: Verify platform-specific requirements

If you are not using any of the following platforms, you are good to go! Otherwise, just one more step. 

- [AKS]({{sitebase.url}}/get-started/connect/aks)
- [GKE]({{sitebase.url}}/get-started/connect/gke)
- [RKE]({{sitebase.url}}/get-started/connect/rke)
