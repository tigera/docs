| Term                             | Definition                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Kubernetes policy                | The native Kubernetes policy resource for enforing security controls at the pod level. {{prodname}} lets you manage your Kubernetes policies, but also create and manage {{prodname}} policies, which provide a richer set of security controls for pods. |
| Network policy                   | A {{prodname}} resource for enforcing security controls at the pod level. <br />**Scope**: Namespaces where you apply the policy. |
| Global network policy            | A {{prodname}} resource for enforcing security controls at the pod level. <br />**Scope**: Namespaces where you apply the policy. |
| Label                            | Key value pair assigned to {{prodname}}/Kubernetes objects that provide meaningful information for identification. For example, “Application: App1” identifies the **Application App1**. |
| Selector                         | Used to match labels in your Kubernetes cluster and select endpoints with these labels. |
| Network set                      | A {{prodname}} resource to define endpoints that are external to the Kubernetes cluster, and assign labels to them for reference in the Kubernetes cluster. <br />**Scope**: Namespace where you apply the network set. |
| Global  network set              | A {{prodname}} resource to define endpoints external to the Kubernetes cluster, and assign label to them for reference in the Kubernetes cluster. <br />**Scope**: Cluster-wide. |
| Ingress                          | Security controls that you apply to network traffic flows *destined to* selected endpoints. |
| Egress                           | Security controls that you apply to network traffic flows *originating from* selected endpoints |
| Tiers                            | A {{prodname}} resource that is a collection of logically grouped network policies and/or global network policies, based on the scope of controls. |
| Microsegmentation                | A method of creating intelligent workload groupings based on characteristics of the workloads communicating inside the data center. {{prodname}} network tiered policy allows a single policy language to protect east-west traffic — server-to-server, application-to-server, web-to-server, etc. |
| Allow/Deny/Pass                  | Actions that you can apply to pods in {{prodname}} network policy or global network policy. |
| Endpoint                         | {{prodname}} supports workload endpoints such as a Kubernetes pod. |
| RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) | How you authenticate and authorize access and limit actions on Kubernetes resources and {{prodname}} resources. <br />**Scope**: Namespace (using role and role-binding), or cluster (using cluster-role and cluster-role-binding) |
