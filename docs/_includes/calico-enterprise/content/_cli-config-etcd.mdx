## Complete list of etcdv3 configuration options

| Configuration file option  | Environment variable | Description                                                                           | Schema
| ---------------------------| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------
| `datastoreType`            | `DATASTORE_TYPE`     | Indicates the datastore to use. If unspecified, defaults to `etcdv3`. (optional)      | `kubernetes`, `etcdv3`
| `etcdEndpoints`            | `ETCD_ENDPOINTS`     | A comma separated list of etcd endpoints. Example: `http://127.0.0.1:2379` (required) | string
| `etcdUsername`             | `ETCD_USERNAME`      | User name for RBAC. Example: `user` (optional)                                        | string
| `etcdPassword`             | `ETCD_PASSWORD`      | Password for the given user name. Example: `password` (optional)                      | string
| `etcdKeyFile`              | `ETCD_KEY_FILE`      | Path to the file containing the private key of the `{{include.cli}}` client certificate. Enables `{{include.cli}}` to participate in mutual TLS authentication and identify itself to the etcd server. Example: `/etc/calico/key.pem` (optional) | string
| `etcdCertFile`             | `ETCD_CERT_FILE`     | Path to the file containing the client certificate issued to `{{include.cli}}`. Enables `{{include.cli}}` to participate in mutual TLS authentication and identify itself to the etcd server. Example: `/etc/calico/cert.pem` (optional) | string
| `etcdCACertFile`           | `ETCD_CA_CERT_FILE`  | Unnecessary if the CA that issued the etcd server certificate is in the list of trusted root CAs on the `{{include.cli}}` host. Otherwise, use this parameter to supply `{{include.cli}}` with the path to the file containing the root certificate of the CA that issued the etcd server certificate. Configures `{{include.cli}}` to trust the signature on the certificates provided by the etcd server. Example: `/etc/calico/ca.pem` (optional) | string

:::note

- We recommend you use TLS and restrict access to the certificates to cluster administrators.
If you are running with TLS enabled, ensure your endpoint addresses use HTTPS.
- When specifying through environment variables, the `DATASTORE_TYPE` environment
is not required for etcdv3.
- All environment variables may also be prefixed with `CALICO_`, for example
`CALICO_DATASTORE_TYPE` and `CALICO_ETCD_ENDPOINTS` etc. may also be used.
This is useful if the non-prefixed names clash with existing environment
variables defined on your system
- Previous versions of `{{include.cli}}` supported `ETCD_SCHEME` and `ETC_AUTHORITY` environment
variables as a mechanism for specifying the etcd endpoints. These variables are
no longer supported. Use `ETCD_ENDPOINTS` instead.
- In kubeadm deployments, {{prodname}} is not configured to use the etcd run by kubeadm
on the Kubernetes master. Instead, it launches its own instance of etcd as a pod,
available at `http://10.96.232.136:6666`. Ensure you are connecting to the correct etcd
or you will not see any of the expected data.
