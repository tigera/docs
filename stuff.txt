./calico-cloud/release-notes/index.mdx:63:* Enhanced filtering options in the endpoints page of the web console.
./calico-cloud/release-notes/index.mdx:294:We've updated the Endpoints page in the web console with a new flow logs panel so you can view and filter Endpoints associated with denied traffic. Flow log metadata includes the source, destination, ports, protocols, and other key forms. We've also updated the Policy Board to highlight policies with denied traffic.
./calico-cloud/release-notes/index.mdx:391:* Code changes to the Kubernetes controller-runtime led to intermittent errors in how the Container Threat Detection status was displayed in the web console.
./calico-cloud/release-notes/index.mdx:462:- the web console shows the enterprise license countdown at the top of the screen even for paid customers
./calico-cloud/release-notes/index.mdx:725:With Container Threat Detection, you can monitor container activity using eBPF. Enable this feature to receive alerts based on file and process activity for known malicious and suspicious behavior. Alert events can be viewed on the Alerts page in the web console.

./calico-cloud/release-notes/index.mdx:832:$[prodname] introduces malware detection in tech preview, which uses eBPF-based monitoring to log observed file hashes of programs running in your $[prodname] Kubernetes clusters. Malware detection identifies malicious files by comparing observed file hashes with our threat intelligence library of known malware, and generates alerts when malware is detected in your cluster. Alerts can be viewed on the Alerts page of the web console.

./calico-cloud/operations/comms/manager-tls.mdx:9:Provide TLS certificates that secure access to the $[prodname] web console user interface.
./calico-cloud/operations/comms/manager-tls.mdx:13:By default, the $[prodname] web console uses self-signed TLS certificates on connections. This article describes how to provide TLS certificates that users' browsers will trust.
./calico-cloud/operations/comms/manager-tls.mdx:17:- **Get the certificate and key pair for the $[prodname] web console**
./calico-cloud/operations/comms/manager-tls.mdx:21:The certificate must have Common Name or Subject Alternate Names that match the IPs or DNS names that will be used to [access the web console](/operations/cnx/access-the-manager/).
./calico-cloud/operations/comms/manager-tls.mdx:37:If the $[prodname] web console is already running then updating the secret should cause it to restart and pickup the new certificate and key. This will result in a short period of unavailability of the $[prodname] web console.
